        "# Machine Translation with RNN Encoder-Decoder\n",
        "\n",
        "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been widely used in machine translation tasks, particularly for sequence-to-sequence modeling. Here's how RNNs can be applied to machine translation:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Encoder-Decoder Architecture:** RNNs are often used in a specific architecture called the encoder-decoder model. The encoder takes the source language sentence as input and processes it sequentially, word by word, capturing the contextual information and representing it as a fixed-length vector, often referred to as the \"context\" or \"thought\" vector. The encoder typically consists of recurrent layers, such as LSTM or GRU, which maintain a hidden state that carries information from previous words to the next.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Attention Mechanism:** In machine translation, long sentences or phrases can be challenging to translate accurately, as the entire sentence needs to be encoded into a fixed-length vector. To address this, attention mechanisms were introduced. Attention allows the decoder to focus on different parts of the source sentence while generating the translation. It dynamically determines which words in the source sentence are most relevant at each decoding step.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Decoding and Generation:** Once the encoder has processed the source sentence and produced the context vector, the decoder RNN takes over. It generates the translated sentence word by word, conditioned on the context vector and the previously generated words. At each decoding step, the decoder RNN takes the context vector, the previously generated word, and the hidden state as input, and predicts the probability distribution over the target vocabulary. The word with the highest probability is selected as the output, and the process continues until an end-of-sentence token is generated.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Training and Optimization:** RNNs in machine translation are trained using parallel corpora, which consist of pairs of source and target language sentences. During training, the model is optimized to minimize the difference between the predicted translation and the target translation. This is typically done using maximum likelihood estimation or variants of it, such as teacher forcing. Optimization techniques like backpropagation through time (BPTT) are used to update the parameters of the encoder and decoder RNNs.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Beam Search:** During inference, when generating translations for unseen sentences, beam search is often employed. Instead of greedily selecting the word with the highest probability at each decoding step, beam search explores multiple hypotheses simultaneously. It maintains a beam of the most likely partial translations and expands them based on the predicted probabilities. This allows the model to consider a wider range of possibilities and generate more accurate translations.\n",
        "\n",
        "RNN-based machine translation models have demonstrated impressive performance and have been the dominant approach for a long time. However, they can still face challenges in capturing long-range dependencies and dealing with out-of-vocabulary words. More recent approaches, such as transformer-based models, have shown significant improvements in machine translation tasks. Nonetheless, RNNs remain foundational in understanding the evolution of machine translation models.\n",
        "\n",
        "The image below, taken from the lecture slides, shows encoder-decoder architecture proposed by [Sutskever et al. in 2014](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2014/file/a14ac55a4f27472c5d894ec1c3c743d2-Paper.pdf). In this architecture, both the encoder and decoder are RNNs, with the last hidden state of the encoder serving as the initial hidden state of the decoder.\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src='data/images/rnn-encoder-decoder-mt.png' />\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we will build and train a simple machine learning model from scratch, based on this RNN encoder-decoder architecture. The implementation presented will also include the concept of **attention**. Attention is a mechanism used in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and other sequence-to-sequence models to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence when generating an output. It allows the model to selectively attend to different parts of the input sequence based on their importance or relevance to the current step of the decoding process.\n",
        "\n",
        "In traditional RNN models, such as the vanilla RNN or LSTM, the hidden state at each time step summarizes all the information from the previous steps. However, this fixed-length representation can be limiting, especially when processing long sequences or when certain parts of the input sequence are more important than others. Attention mechanisms address this limitation by dynamically computing a weighted sum of the input sequence, emphasizing certain parts that are more relevant to the current decoding step. It enables the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence with different weights, allowing it to focus on the most relevant information.\n",
        "\n",
        "In an RNN-based encoder-decoder architecture, the attention mechanism computes relevance scores by measuring the similarity between the current hidden state of the decoder and each hidden state of the encoder. There are various ways to calculate these scores, such as dot product, cosine similarity, or using a learned compatibility function. The scores are usually transformed into attention weights through a softmax function to ensure they sum up to 1. Finally, the attention weights are used to compute a weighted sum of the hidden states of the encoder, resulting in a context vector. This context vector is then combined with the current decoding step's hidden state to generate the output or update the hidden state for the next step. The images below, taken from the lecture slides, visualize the computations involved in the attention mechanisms\n",

        "By incorporating attention mechanisms, RNN models can selectively attend to different parts of the input sequence, giving them the ability to effectively process long sequences, focus on important information, and improve the quality of their predictions or translations. The implementation of our machine translation model will be flexible enough to specify if attention should be used or not."

By applying gradient clipping, the overall effect is that the magnitude of the gradients is kept under control, preventing them from becoming too large.

However, if we want to properly train a model, we have to properly prepare each batch before calling the method `train_batch()`. This mainly means that we need to append the `<EOS>` token to each of the input and target sequences. We perform these steps in the method `train()` below that performs the complete training of our model. As you have seen in previous notebooks, this method essentially iterates over all batches and calls `train_batch` for each batch. The outer loop reflects how many epochs we want to train the model."

        "This notebook went through all the basic steps required to build an RNN-based machine translation model. Apart from using only a small dataset for training, we also we skipped any proper evaluation of our model, which is a very non-trivial task in itself. Machine translation models are evaluated by comparing their generated translations with reference translations, typically done on a separate set of data called the evaluation or test set. The evaluation process measures the quality of the translations and assesses how well the model performs in terms of accuracy, fluency, and overall translation adequacy. Common metrics used for evaluating machine translation models include:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy):** BLEU is a widely used metric for machine translation evaluation. It measures the overlap between the model's generated translations and the reference translations based on n-grams (contiguous sequences of words). BLEU computes a precision score by comparing n-gram matches and penalizes overly long translations. Higher BLEU scores indicate better translation quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **METEOR (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering):** METEOR is another popular metric that considers both precision and recall by matching unigrams (individual words) between the generated and reference translations. It also incorporates additional features such as stemming, synonym matching, and word order information. METEOR provides a score that correlates with human judgment of translation quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **TER (Translation Edit Rate):** TER calculates the minimum number of edit operations (such as insertions, deletions, substitutions, and shifts) required to transform the generated translation into the reference translation. Lower TER scores indicate better translation quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation):** ROUGE is primarily used for evaluating text summarization tasks, but it can also be adapted for machine translation evaluation. It measures the overlap of n-grams and word sequences between the generated and reference translations. ROUGE scores are commonly used in research papers to compare machine translation models.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **NIST (NIST BLEU):** NIST is an extension of the BLEU metric that incorporates features like document-level statistics and different n-gram weighting schemes. It aims to align the metric with human evaluation and correlation.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Human Evaluation:* While automatic metrics provide a quick and objective assessment, human evaluation is crucial to gauge translation quality accurately. Human evaluators assess the translations based on fluency, adequacy, grammaticality, and overall meaning. They can also provide insights into other aspects of translation, such as domain-specific accuracy or stylistic appropriateness.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's important to note that automatic metrics like BLEU, METEOR, TER, and ROUGE have limitations and may not perfectly align with human judgments. They are used as rough indicators and for comparing different models or approaches. Human evaluation remains an essential component to capture the nuances and quality aspects that automatic metrics may not fully capture."

        "\n",
        "Machine translation can be effectively addressed using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in natural language processing (NLP). RNNs are a class of neural networks designed to handle sequential data, making them well-suited for tasks like language translation. The key idea is to use an encoder-decoder architecture, where the input sentence is encoded into a fixed-length representation and then decoded into the target language. In this setup, the RNN encoder processes the source sentence word by word, capturing the contextual information and producing a meaningful representation known as the context vector. The context vector contains a condensed representation of the input sentence's semantic and syntactic information.\n",
        "\n",
        "The RNN decoder takes the context vector as its initial input and generates the output translation one word at a time. At each time step, the decoder RNN uses the previously generated word and its own internal state to predict the next word in the target language. The process continues until the decoder generates an end-of-sentence token or reaches a predefined length. During training, the model is optimized to minimize the discrepancy between the generated translations and the reference translations. This is done by using techniques like teacher forcing, where the model is fed with the true output tokens during training to guide its learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "The power of RNNs lies in their ability to capture the sequential dependencies and handle variable-length input and output sequences. The recurrent connections within the RNN enable the model to retain and utilize information from previous time steps. This makes RNN-based machine translation models capable of handling both short and long sentences while preserving the syntactic and semantic coherence in the translations. Overall, using recurrent neural networks for machine translation in NLP provides a flexible and effective framework to handle the complexities of language translation, allowing for improved translation quality and better preservation of the meaning and structure across different languages."
