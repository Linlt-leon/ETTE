It O
's O
difficult O
answer B-INCORRECT
at B-INCORRECT
the O
question O
" O
what O
are O
you O
going O
to O
do O
in O
future O
? O
if O
only O
one O
who O
has O
know O
it O
is O
two O
minds O
. O

When O
I B-INCORRECT
was O
younger O
used O
to O
say O
that O
wanted O
be O
a O
teacher O
, O
saleswoman O
and O
even O
butcher O
.. B-INCORRECT
do O
n't O
know O
why O
. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
study O
Psychology O
because B-INCORRECT
one O
day O
open B-INCORRECT
my O
own O
psychology O
office B-INCORRECT
and O
help O
people O
. O

It O
's O
difficult O
because O
I O
'll O
have O
to O
study O
hard O
and O
a O
lot O
, O
but O
think O
that O
if O
you O
like O
subject O
it O
easier B-INCORRECT
. O

Maybe O
I O
'll O
change O
my O
mind O
, O
maybe O
not O
. O

I O
think O
that O
the B-INCORRECT
public O
transport O
will O
always O
be B-INCORRECT
in O
future O
. O

The B-INCORRECT
rich B-INCORRECT
people O
will O
buy O
a O
car O
but B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
poor O
always O
need O
to O
use O
bus O
or O
taxi O
. O

I O
consider O
that B-INCORRECT
is B-INCORRECT
more O
convenient O
to O
drive O
a O
car O
because B-INCORRECT
you O
carry O
on B-INCORRECT
things O
in O
your O
own O
than O
travelling B-INCORRECT
by O
. O

Also O
, O
you O
'll O
meet O
friendly O
people O
who O
usually O
ask O
to B-INCORRECT
something B-INCORRECT
be O
friends O
and O
change B-INCORRECT
your B-INCORRECT
telephone O
number B-INCORRECT
. O

In O
my O
experience O
when B-INCORRECT
I O
did O
n't O
have O
a O
car O
used O
to O
use O
the B-INCORRECT
bus O
go O
school O
and O
back O
house O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
car O
is O
n't O
necessary O
when O
you B-INCORRECT
have O
crashed O
in B-INCORRECT
street O
that O
moment O
realized B-INCORRECT
importance O
of O
a B-INCORRECT
public O
transport O
. O

In O
India O
we B-INCORRECT
have O
various O
types O
of O
Public B-INCORRECT
transport O
, O
like O
Cycle B-INCORRECT
Bike B-INCORRECT
Car B-INCORRECT
Train B-INCORRECT
& O
Flight B-INCORRECT
. O

Depending O
on O
the O
distance O
and O
duration B-INCORRECT
to O
desired O
place B-INCORRECT
, O
mode B-INCORRECT
of O
transport O
is O
chosen O
accordingly O
. O

But O
Generally B-INCORRECT
speaking O
, O
travelling O
by O
car O
is O
much O
more O
fun O
when O
compared O
with O
other O
modes O
of O
transport O
. O

This O
reminds O
me O
of O
a O
trip O
that O
I O
have O
recently O
been O
to B-INCORRECT
and O
the O
place O
is B-INCORRECT
Agra O
. O

It O
takes O
around O
6 O
hours O
by O
National B-INCORRECT
highway O
to O
go O
from O
Delhi O
Agra O
. O

We O
have B-INCORRECT
stopped O
at O
hotels O
for B-INCORRECT
having B-INCORRECT
food O
and O
just O
in O
case O
if B-INCORRECT
any O
of O
us O
feels B-INCORRECT
hungry O
, O
we O
purchased O
some O
snacks O
before O
the O
trip O
. O

Since O
, O
we O
have O
the O
option O
to O
wait B-INCORRECT
anytime O
want O
when O
travel O
by O
car O
( O
which O
is O
impossible O
travelling O
train O
& B-INCORRECT
Flight B-INCORRECT
) O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
it B-INCORRECT
, O
we O
can O
also O
take O
a O
comfortable O
short O
nap O
on O
the O
back O
seat O
and O
wake O
up O
fresh O
. O

Due B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
the O
above O
mentioned B-INCORRECT
reasons O
, O
I O
am O
going O
conclude O
that O
travelling O
by O
car O
is O
much O
more O
convenient O
. O

My O
name O
is O
Sarah O
. O

I O
am O
17 O
years O
old O
. O

I O
am O
looking O
forward O

addition O
to O
that O
, O
i B-INCORRECT
enjoy O

My O
family O
think O
that O
my O

is O
amazing O

that O

chance O
to O

Dear O
Jo O
, O

How O
are O
you O
? O
I O
'm O
writing O
to O
inform B-INCORRECT
that B-INCORRECT
some O
advice O
on O
travelling O
and O
working O
in O
my O
country O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
in O
my O
country O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
place B-INCORRECT
to O
travel B-INCORRECT
. O

For O
example O
Barcelona B-INCORRECT
, O
Madrid O
Sevilla O
Valencia O
. O

There O
are O
wonderful O
cities O
because O
there O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
to O
visit O
for B-INCORRECT
example O
in B-INCORRECT
Madrid O
you O
can O
" O
Puerta O
del O
Sol O
, O
Las O
Cibeles O
. O

I O
visit O
Madrid O
twice O
a O
year O
. O

All B-INCORRECT
summer O
I O
visit O
Sevilla O
because O
love O
this O
city O
and O
suggest O
that O
you O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
in O
my O
country O
there O
are O
a B-INCORRECT
few O
job B-INCORRECT
because O
economy O
is O
very O
bad O
. O

But O
, O
if O
you O
want O
I B-INCORRECT
look B-INCORRECT
for O
a O
job O
from B-INCORRECT
. O

My O
best O
friend O
looking B-INCORRECT
for B-INCORRECT
a O
people B-INCORRECT
responsible B-INCORRECT
look O
after O
her O
sister O
. O

Her O
sister O
is O
6 O
years O
old O
and O
you O
should B-INCORRECT
look O
after O
every B-INCORRECT
weekend O
. O

You B-INCORRECT
will B-INCORRECT
be O
interesting B-INCORRECT
in O
this O
job O
? O

Thank O
you B-INCORRECT
for O
e O
- O
mail O
, B-INCORRECT
it B-INCORRECT
was O
wonderful O
to O
hear O
from O
. O

I O
'm O
looking O
forward O
to O
seeing O
you O
. O

Take O
care O
, O
Laura O
. O

Today O
public B-INCORRECT
transport B-INCORRECT
still O
play B-INCORRECT
an O
important O
role O
in B-INCORRECT
system O
and O
it O
will O
keep O
on O
the O
future O
. O

Because O
public O
transport O
is O
a O
cost B-INCORRECT
effective B-INCORRECT
and O
better O
resource O
allocation O
in O
mass O
system O
. O

Also O
people B-INCORRECT
need O
not O
to B-INCORRECT
suffer O
high B-INCORRECT
operating O
cost O
running B-INCORRECT
their O
own O
car O
. O

But O
it B-INCORRECT
can O
use O
a O
cheaper O
way O
going B-INCORRECT
to O
their O
destination O
especially B-INCORRECT
is O
far O
away O
from O
home O
. O

For O
example O
, O
I O
think O
that O
it O
is O
not O
affordable O
for O
an O
ordinary O
person O
to O
own O
a O
private O
airplane O
travelling B-INCORRECT
another O
country O
. O

Instead O
it B-INCORRECT
will O
be O
common O
to O
buy O
an O
air O
ticket O
and O
ride B-INCORRECT
on O
public B-INCORRECT
plane O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
I B-INCORRECT
think B-INCORRECT
that B-INCORRECT
public O
transport O
in B-INCORRECT
future B-INCORRECT
is B-INCORRECT
going B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
continue B-INCORRECT
be B-INCORRECT
used B-INCORRECT
because O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
does B-INCORRECT
n't O
have O
enough O
money O
pay O
for O
car O
even B-INCORRECT
if O
it O
, O
so O
but O
use O
more B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
cars B-INCORRECT
then B-INCORRECT
bus B-INCORRECT
or O
underground B-INCORRECT
. O

If O
we O
think O
about O
it O
the B-INCORRECT
car B-INCORRECT
is O
better O
because O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
wait O
for O
them B-INCORRECT
has B-INCORRECT
are B-INCORRECT
waiting B-INCORRECT
bus O
or O
underground O
but B-INCORRECT
in B-INCORRECT
another B-INCORRECT
way B-INCORRECT
cust B-INCORRECT
more O
money O
than O
public O
transport O
. O

By B-INCORRECT
car O
we B-INCORRECT
can O
just O
stay B-INCORRECT
with B-INCORRECT
ourselves O
which B-INCORRECT
be O
good O
because O
listen O
to O
the B-INCORRECT
music O
that O
like O
and B-INCORRECT
do O
n't O
need O
around O
people O
are O
unkwoned B-INCORRECT
but O
if O
chose B-INCORRECT
public O
transport O
meet O
friends O
or O
family O
so B-INCORRECT
both O
trasnportations B-INCORRECT
cars O
necessarialy B-INCORRECT
end B-INCORRECT
up B-INCORRECT
. O

If O
I B-INCORRECT
had O
it B-INCORRECT
to O
choose O
between O
both O
transportation B-INCORRECT
think O
probably B-INCORRECT
chose B-INCORRECT
car O
because O
is O
better O
for O
me O
go O
by O
then B-INCORRECT
bus O
. O

In O
my O
community O
, O
we O
are O
very O
interested O
at B-INCORRECT
environment B-INCORRECT
and O
ecological O
things O
. O

We O
have O
solar O
panels O
and O
a O
place O
to O
make O
compost O
at B-INCORRECT
the O
last B-INCORRECT
garden O
, O
with O
worms O
who B-INCORRECT
eat O
degrade O
all O
organic O
waste O
of O
school O
. O

In B-INCORRECT
some O
strategic O
points O
of B-INCORRECT
the O
building O
we B-INCORRECT
have O
special O
trashcans O
to O
separate O
garbage O
in B-INCORRECT
organic O
, O
paper O
and O
cardboard O
cans O
pet B-INCORRECT
bottles O
they O
also O
made B-INCORRECT
talks O
presentations O
about O
earth O
problems B-INCORRECT
like B-INCORRECT
global O
warming O
contamination B-INCORRECT
etc O
. O

The O
manager O
of O
all B-INCORRECT

project O

teacher O

initiatives O
has B-INCORRECT

about O
is B-INCORRECT
my O
favorite O

much!Example B-INCORRECT
like B-INCORRECT
Barclay O
Premier O
League O
Liga O
Fifa O
World O

and O
on O

I O
believe O
that O
's B-INCORRECT
all B-INCORRECT
will O
delighted B-INCORRECT

. O

By O
the O
way O
, B-INCORRECT
my O
favorite O

Manchester O
United O

are O
brilliant O
have O
an B-INCORRECT
amazing O
players O
and O
awesome O

Michael O
was O
a O
little O
kid O
when O
he O
had O
dream O
that O
: O
Be B-INCORRECT
super O
hero O
! O

After O
many O
years O
he B-INCORRECT
still O
dream B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
become B-INCORRECT
a O
super O
hero O
. O

He O
enter B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
university O
of B-INCORRECT
medicine O
because O
he O
thinks B-INCORRECT
that O
this B-INCORRECT
profession O
was O
more B-INCORRECT
similar O
to O
be B-INCORRECT
a O
super O
hero O
. O

Pass B-INCORRECT
some O
years O
of B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
university O
and B-INCORRECT
he O
know B-INCORRECT
a O
girl O
called O
Kate O
get B-INCORRECT
loved B-INCORRECT
on B-INCORRECT
here B-INCORRECT
she O
in B-INCORRECT
him O
. O

Kate O
was O
cursing B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
university O
of B-INCORRECT
fashion O
. O

Then O
the O
two O
started O
to O
date O
. O

Michael O
and O
Kate O
was B-INCORRECT
so O
happy O
, B-INCORRECT
until O
one O
day O
that B-INCORRECT
said B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
him B-INCORRECT
dream B-INCORRECT
be B-INCORRECT
a O
super O
hero B-INCORRECT
get B-INCORRECT
nervous B-INCORRECT
saying O
it O
ridiculous O
just O
kid O
only O
dreaming O
but B-INCORRECT
would O
never O
happen O
do B-INCORRECT
n't O
exist O
. O

When O
she O
said O
that O
, O
Michael O
started O
to O
cry O
and O
get B-INCORRECT
mad O
saying B-INCORRECT
was O
lying O
do B-INCORRECT
n't O
have O
heart B-INCORRECT
. O

He O
got O
so O
mad O
that O
he O
asked O
her O
to O
get O
out O
of O
his O
apartment O
. O

In B-INCORRECT
following O
day O
, O
she O
said O
sorry O
and O
them B-INCORRECT
was B-INCORRECT
happy O
again O
. O

But O
when O
them B-INCORRECT
get B-INCORRECT
to O
the B-INCORRECT
home B-INCORRECT
of B-INCORRECT
Michael B-INCORRECT
they O
fight B-INCORRECT
again O
and O
a O
knife O
kill O
her O
. O

He O
cried O
with O
a O
lot O
blood B-INCORRECT
around O
. O

Michael O
get B-INCORRECT
away O
from O
there O
. O

Michael O
closed O
the O
door O
and O
knew O
at O
that O
moment O
he O
had O
made O
a O
mistake O
. O

Public O
transportation O
is O
an O
important O
invention O
in O
human O
history O
, B-INCORRECT
it B-INCORRECT
brings O
amount B-INCORRECT
of O
benefits O
our O
life O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
we O
take O
subway B-INCORRECT
in O
order O
to O
avoid O
stocking B-INCORRECT
traffic O
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
moving B-INCORRECT
by O
car O
more O
convenient O
than O
take B-INCORRECT
public O
transportation O
, B-INCORRECT
however B-INCORRECT
it O
would B-INCORRECT
cause O
damage O
to O
our O
life O
and O
harm O
environment O
. O

Therefore O
, O
we O
need O
to O
think O
more O
about O
our O
future O
offsprings B-INCORRECT
. O

Giving O
them O
a O
safe O
, O
clean O
and O
comfortable O
place O
to O
live O
. O

If O
there O
is O
no O
public O
transportation O
, O
traffic O
jam B-INCORRECT
will O
be O
serious B-INCORRECT
than O
before O
. O

In O
my O
country B-INCORRECT
, O
taipei B-INCORRECT
we O
always B-INCORRECT
stock B-INCORRECT
in O
traffic O
for O
about O
one O
hour O
the O
morning O
. O

I B-INCORRECT
can O
not O
imagine O
if B-INCORRECT
there B-INCORRECT
is B-INCORRECT
no B-INCORRECT
bus B-INCORRECT
or B-INCORRECT
MRT B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
how B-INCORRECT
long B-INCORRECT
will B-INCORRECT
take B-INCORRECT
for B-INCORRECT
school B-INCORRECT
. O

Car B-INCORRECT
is O
convenient O
for O
human B-INCORRECT
, O
but O
it O
brings O
damage O
also B-INCORRECT
. O

For O
example O
, O
carbon O
dioxide O
which B-INCORRECT
is O
created B-INCORRECT
by O
car B-INCORRECT
. O

It O
cause B-INCORRECT
global O
warming O
which B-INCORRECT
threats B-INCORRECT
our O
environment O
and O
harms O
daily O
life O
. O

we B-INCORRECT
can O
see O
that O
there O
are O
lots O
of O
serious O
and O
frequently B-INCORRECT
weather O
disaster B-INCORRECT
happened B-INCORRECT
in O
decades B-INCORRECT
, O
such O
as O
typhoon B-INCORRECT
hurricane B-INCORRECT
wild O
fire B-INCORRECT
mud O
slide B-INCORRECT
. O

What O
other O
precautions O
, B-INCORRECT
is B-INCORRECT
usually O
taken O
? O

The O
NG O
Office O
is O
notified O
by O
the O
photographer O
when O
film O
was O
shipped O
. O

If O
the O
film O
does O
n't O
arrive O
on O
time O
, O
it O
immediately O
. O

Lost O
shipments O
have O
been O
found O
more O
easily O
when O
this O
process O
will B-INCORRECT
be B-INCORRECT
started O
right O
away O

The O
pleasure O
of O
traveling O

People O
go O
, O
people O
come O
. O

Every O
day O
lots O
of O
people O
are O
travelling O
abroad O
but O
, O
what O
's O
the O
best O
way O
to O
do O
an O
international O
travel B-INCORRECT
? O

The O
most O
important O
option O
to B-INCORRECT
travel O
is O
, O
by O
far O
the O
plane O
. O

But O
, O
even O
when B-INCORRECT
it O
's O
true O
that O
the O
faster B-INCORRECT
option O
you O
must O
be O
very O
carefuly B-INCORRECT
at B-INCORRECT
time O
to O
get O
off O
a O
plane O
. O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
confort B-INCORRECT
and O
relax B-INCORRECT
, O
obviously O
have O
to O
take O
a O

Transportation O
one B-INCORRECT
of O
the O
most O
important O
thing B-INCORRECT
on B-INCORRECT
life O
so B-INCORRECT
we O
have O
many O
kinds O
for B-INCORRECT
transportation O
now B-INCORRECT
travel O
by O
car O
but B-INCORRECT
in O
near O
future O
it B-INCORRECT
will O
be O
other O
comfort B-INCORRECT
and O
easy O
ways O
to O
like B-INCORRECT
fast O
train B-INCORRECT
plane B-INCORRECT
that O
can O
transport O
you O
from O
north O
south O
less O
than O
hour B-INCORRECT
this B-INCORRECT
make O
business B-INCORRECT
men B-INCORRECT
happy O
because O
saving O
a O
lot O
times B-INCORRECT
efforts B-INCORRECT
hope O
government O
achieve O
way B-INCORRECT
as O
soon O
possible O

In O
modern O
societies O
, O
there O
are O
lots O
of O
friends O
around B-INCORRECT
our O
daily O
lives O
. O

Big O
project B-INCORRECT
could O
not O
be O
finished O
without O
co B-INCORRECT
- B-INCORRECT
operations B-INCORRECT
. O

Friends O
could B-INCORRECT
be B-INCORRECT
communicated B-INCORRECT
and O
exchanged B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
ideas O
, O
feelings O
funny O
things O
happened B-INCORRECT
around O
ourselves B-INCORRECT
. O

More O
importantly O
, O
the B-INCORRECT
parents O
give O
our B-INCORRECT
lives B-INCORRECT
and O
they O
touch B-INCORRECT
us O
knowledge O
skills O
or O
abilities O
to O
live O
in O
this O
world O
. O

In O
this O
case O
, O
the B-INCORRECT
families B-INCORRECT
played B-INCORRECT
important O
roles O
in O
daily B-INCORRECT
lives O
. O

The O
reasons O
are O
as O
follows O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
we O
could B-INCORRECT
learn O
lots O
skills O
from O
parents O
according B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
their O
own O
experience O
. O

For O
example O
, O
we O
could B-INCORRECT
learn O
how O
to O
communicate O
with O
others O
in O
a O
friendly O
way O
and O
also O
make O
meal O
from O
parents O
. O

Secondly O
, O
the B-INCORRECT
families B-INCORRECT
could B-INCORRECT
give O
you O
some O
advice O
about O
how O
to O
deal O
with O
things O
which O
will B-INCORRECT
cause O
trouble B-INCORRECT
. O

If O
difficulties O
was B-INCORRECT
told B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
families B-INCORRECT
, O
ideas O
would B-INCORRECT
come O
up O
your O
and O
communicate B-INCORRECT
with O
you O
about O
how O
solve O
this O
situation O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
this O
case O
the B-INCORRECT
families B-INCORRECT
are O
most O
important O
friends O
our O
lives O
. O

The B-INCORRECT
Computing O
Technology O
has O
been O
advancing O
very B-INCORRECT
much B-INCORRECT
this B-INCORRECT
last B-INCORRECT
years O
, O
making O
the O
old O
computers O
almost O
useless O
getting O
better O
and B-INCORRECT
difference O
between O
new O
grow O
even O
more O
with O
every O
discoverement B-INCORRECT
. O

As O
we O
can O
notice B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
old B-INCORRECT
and O
new O
computers O
are O
vastly O
different O
starting O
from O
the O
size O
of O
were O
much O
bigger O
than O
. O

Old O
computers O
were B-INCORRECT
used O
to O
occupy O
one O
entire O
room O
, O
now O
they O
only B-INCORRECT
have B-INCORRECT
the O
size O
of O
a O
box O
even O
book O
. O

You O
can O
have O
a O
portable O
computer O
now O
, O
and O
take O
it O
with O
you O
to O
every O
place O
visit O
. O

Old O
computers O
only O
let O
you O
make B-INCORRECT
math O
tasks O
, O
or O
even O
play O
simple O
games O
with O
2 O
colors O
( O
green O

black O
) O
but O
now O
can O
do O
whatever O
want O
to O
like O
creating O
playing O
videogames B-INCORRECT
writing O
reading O
a O
book O
connect O
the B-INCORRECT

invent O
new O
stuff O
improve O
Computing O
Technology O
not O
in O
thousand B-INCORRECT
of O
them O
. O

One O
of O
the O
greatest O
achievements O
new O
computing O
, B-INCORRECT
is O

where O
you O
can O

public B-INCORRECT
transportation O
has O
been O
more B-INCORRECT
used B-INCORRECT
by B-INCORRECT
people B-INCORRECT
and B-INCORRECT
over O
the O
years O
it O
is B-INCORRECT
kind O
of O
becoming O
cheaper O
also O
safe B-INCORRECT
but O
some O
prefer O
cars O
to B-INCORRECT
extent O
do O
we B-INCORRECT
agree O
with O
what O
our O
reasons O
for O
that B-INCORRECT
are B-INCORRECT
going O
demonstrate O
in O
this O
essay O

before B-INCORRECT
about B-INCORRECT
40 B-INCORRECT
years B-INCORRECT
there O
was B-INCORRECT
nothing O
called O
public O
transportation O
and O
people O
rarely O
owned O
cars B-INCORRECT
so B-INCORRECT
in B-INCORRECT
those O
not O
even O
good O
facility B-INCORRECT
to O
move O
from O
place B-INCORRECT
other B-INCORRECT
that O
is O
because O
no O
companies O
build O
10 O
trading O
became O
viable O
also O
very O
supported O
by B-INCORRECT
having O
her O
own O
fans O
at B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
beginning O
faced O
a O
lot O
of O
problems O
but B-INCORRECT
they O
were O
able O
solve O
it B-INCORRECT
end O

nowadays B-INCORRECT
all O
facilities B-INCORRECT
of B-INCORRECT
travelling B-INCORRECT
are O
more B-INCORRECT
convenient O
from B-INCORRECT
cars O
to O
buses O
even B-INCORRECT
trains O
and O
planes O
.some B-INCORRECT
people O
prefer O
because O
the B-INCORRECT
do O
like B-INCORRECT
crowded O
places O
or O
find O
it O
sometimes B-INCORRECT
cheaper B-INCORRECT
but B-INCORRECT
another O
point O
view O
public B-INCORRECT
transportation O
is O
very O
cheap O
faster O
when O
comes O
traveling O
a B-INCORRECT
lot O
riding B-INCORRECT
their O
own O
feel O
real O
experience O
enjoy O
by O
chilling B-INCORRECT
out B-INCORRECT

to B-INCORRECT
summaries B-INCORRECT
it O
is O
different O
from O
some O
oneis O
opinion O
another O
i B-INCORRECT
predict O
that B-INCORRECT
public O
transportation O
will B-INCORRECT
be O
improved O
and O
people O
use O
more O
by B-INCORRECT
the O
end O
cars B-INCORRECT
disappear O
no O
longer O
used O

The O
topic O
itself O
explaining O
the O
uncertainty O
of O
public O
transport O
in O
our O
country O
. O

This O
conclusion O
become B-INCORRECT
more O
prominent O
if O
we O
look O
into O
the O
data O
of O
car O
companies O
and O
exponential B-INCORRECT
growth O
in O
their O
sales O
figure B-INCORRECT
with B-INCORRECT
low O
budget O
private O
cars O
picture B-INCORRECT
, O
scenario B-INCORRECT
ddrastically B-INCORRECT
changed O
past B-INCORRECT
10 O
years O

Development O
of O
biodiesel B-INCORRECT
industry O
can O
be B-INCORRECT
a O
contribution O
to O
productivity O
growth O
. O

A O
large O
scale O
of O
investment O
was O
bring B-INCORRECT
for B-INCORRECT
biofuel O
development O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
it O
boost B-INCORRECT
economic O
growth O
and O
jobs B-INCORRECT
opportunity B-INCORRECT
thereby O
enhance B-INCORRECT
Gross O
Domestic O
Product O
( O
GDP O
) O
. O

If O
you O
are B-INCORRECT
living B-INCORRECT
in O
big B-INCORRECT
town O
or O
small B-INCORRECT
It B-INCORRECT
does O
matter B-INCORRECT
but B-INCORRECT
one O
thing O
should B-INCORRECT
be O
taking B-INCORRECT
care O
by B-INCORRECT
the O
people O
and O
organiser B-INCORRECT
of O
, O
is O
environment B-INCORRECT
. O

Global O
warming O
is O
huge B-INCORRECT
issue O
in B-INCORRECT
today B-INCORRECT
's B-INCORRECT
date B-INCORRECT
. O

Government B-INCORRECT
should O
take O
immense O
action O
to O
stop O
it O
or O
at O
least O
make O
slow O
down O
. O

However O
we B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
people O
have B-INCORRECT
really O
important O
part O
of B-INCORRECT
making O
it O
worse O
. O

Active O
and O
a O
good O
government O
understand O
the O
value O
of O
taking O
care O
trees O
water O
air O
much O
more O
to B-INCORRECT
provide O
fresh O
, O
clean O
safe O
environment O
their O
people O
. O

Recycling O
item B-INCORRECT
can O
be O
a O
good O
step O
to O
start O
with O
clean B-INCORRECT
and O
safe O
environment O
which B-INCORRECT
is O
perfectly O
promptly O
taking B-INCORRECT
care O
by B-INCORRECT
my O
city O
. O

Everyone O
have B-INCORRECT
to O
plant O
a O
tree O
in O
front O
of O
their O
home O
with B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
rule O
province B-INCORRECT
government O
. O

People O
is B-INCORRECT
not O
realizing B-INCORRECT
that O
cutting O
the B-INCORRECT
tree O
can O
reduce O
production O
of O
oxygen O
in O
atmosphere B-INCORRECT
. O

Eventually O
human B-INCORRECT
will O
have O
no O
more O
fresh O
air O
to O
breath B-INCORRECT
. O

Additionally O
, O
our O
city O
government O
has O
prohibited O
smoking O
in O
public O
area B-INCORRECT
and O
under O
18 O
year B-INCORRECT
old O
provides O
a O
free O
session O
of O
talk B-INCORRECT
or O
presentation B-INCORRECT
to O
increase O
the O
awareness O
clean B-INCORRECT
safe O
fresh O
environment O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
would O
suggest O
to B-INCORRECT
our O
neighbour O
cities O
taking B-INCORRECT
part O
of B-INCORRECT
cleaning O
environment B-INCORRECT
so O
one O
day O
it O
can O
be O
seen O
in O
whole B-INCORRECT
country O
. O

Everybody O
has O
his O
favourite O

Dear O
Paul O
, O

I O
have O
seen O
your O
notice B-INCORRECT
in O
the O
academy O
newspaper O
and O
'm O
quite O
interested O
. O
no O
plans O
for O
this O
summer O
so B-INCORRECT
think O
it O
is O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
spend O

I O
was O
born O
in O
the O
UK O
so B-INCORRECT
can B-INCORRECT
be O
a O
very O
good O
teacher O
of O
English O
. O

Although O
I O
came O
to O
Spain O
ten O
years O
later O
so B-INCORRECT
can B-INCORRECT
speak O
with O
them O
in O
Spanish O
if O
it O
was O
necessary O
. O

Also O
, O
I O
assisted B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
a O
ballet O
course O
for O
4 O
years O
when O
was O
young O
. O

It O
was O
a O
lot B-INCORRECT
of B-INCORRECT
time O
ago O
, O
however B-INCORRECT
I O
still O
keep O
the O
rhthym B-INCORRECT
in O
my O
body O
! O

By O
the O
way O
, O
I O
remember O
had O
to B-INCORRECT
create O
a O
dynamic O
training O
do O
with O
other O
ballet O
- O
course O
members O
. O
be O
teacher O
for O
one O
day O
and O
did B-INCORRECT
n't B-INCORRECT
forget B-INCORRECT
it O
because O
felt O
wonderful O

All O
members O
congratulated O
me O
, O
as O
well O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
I O
had B-INCORRECT
taken B-INCORRECT
care O
of O
my O
brothers O
and O
cousins O
for O
many O
hours O
when O
they O
were O
very O
young O
. O

You O
must B-INCORRECT
know O
that O
I O
'm O
a O
very O
responsible O
, O
kind O
and O
funny O
person O
. O

That O
makes O
me O
a O
good O
candidate O
to O
achieve B-INCORRECT
the O
job O
, O
or O
hobby O
for O
! O

I B-INCORRECT
hope O
you O
keep B-INCORRECT
in B-INCORRECT
mind B-INCORRECT
my O
candidature O
because B-INCORRECT
'm B-INCORRECT
not B-INCORRECT
going B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
disappoint O
. O

Best O
wishes O
, O
Julia O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
public B-INCORRECT
transport O
wo O
n't O
be B-INCORRECT
suffered B-INCORRECT
by B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
shortage O
in B-INCORRECT
demand O
. O

Because O
not O
everyone O
afford B-INCORRECT
to O
buy O
their O
own O
car O
. O

Besides O
there B-INCORRECT
are O
lots O
of O
low O
income B-INCORRECT
people O
who O
ca O
n't O
buy O
their O
own O
car O
. O

So O
I O
think O
public O
transport O
's O
future O
is O
bright O
. O

What O
is B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
" O
Family O
meaning B-INCORRECT
? O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
Family B-INCORRECT
is O
the O
place O
that O
had O
you O
best O
friend O
can O
help O
each O
other O
and O
know O
. O

In O
the B-INCORRECT
Taiwan O
, B-INCORRECT
many O
of B-INCORRECT
people O
have O
to O
take O
care O
them B-INCORRECT
parent B-INCORRECT
when O
they O
get O
old O
but O
point O
is O
what B-INCORRECT
if O
you B-INCORRECT
can O
not O
survival B-INCORRECT
I O
mean O
do O
n't O
enough O
money O
raise B-INCORRECT
. O

Back O
to O
the O
topic O
, B-INCORRECT
I O
do O
n't O
know O
well B-INCORRECT
any O
of O
member B-INCORRECT
in B-INCORRECT
my O
family O
trust O
them O
honestly B-INCORRECT
. O

I O
like O
NewZealand B-INCORRECT
because O
there O
are O
many O
islands O
. O

By O
the O
way O
, O
NewZealand B-INCORRECT
have B-INCORRECT
a B-INCORRECT
cool O
weather O
. O

In O
Malaysia O
, O
the O
weather O
is O
slightly O
warmer O
than O
there O
. O

That O
's O
why O
I O
order B-INCORRECT
all O
of O
you O
to O
go O
there O
and O
feel O
the O
pleasure O
have O
a O
try O
their B-INCORRECT
own B-INCORRECT
food O
. O

You O
can O
also O
bought B-INCORRECT
a O
lot O
of O
gifts O
like B-INCORRECT
key O
chains O
, O
statue B-INCORRECT
or O
what B-INCORRECT
else B-INCORRECT
memories B-INCORRECT
to O
be O
made O
before O
returning O
Malaysia O
. O

I O
did B-INCORRECT
not B-INCORRECT
have B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
go B-INCORRECT
NewZealand B-INCORRECT
but O
believe B-INCORRECT
me O
it B-INCORRECT
is O
very B-INCORRECT
beautiful O
place O
. O

If O
I O
have O
sustenance B-INCORRECT
, O
will O
go O
there O
and O
bring B-INCORRECT
all O
of O
you O
. O

I O
live O
in O
Lentini O
, O
a O
small O
city O
East O
Sicily O
. O

The O
local O
Council B-INCORRECT
hasn't B-INCORRECT
a O
project O
for O
the O
environment O
. O

People O
collect O
any O
kind O
of O
rubbish O
and O
throws B-INCORRECT
all B-INCORRECT
together O
in O
black O
sack B-INCORRECT
. O

Although O
the O
Council B-INCORRECT
began O
to O
plan O
something O
, O
people O
are O
n't O
committed O
with B-INCORRECT
problem O
. O

Around O
the B-INCORRECT
city O
, O
you O
can O
find O
many O
places O
where O
people O
throw O
frigo B-INCORRECT
kitchen B-INCORRECT
" O
amianto O
old O
things O
or O
furniture O
. O

What O
a O
pity O
! O

The O
suburbs O
of O
Lentini O
could O
be O
wonderful O
. O

There O
are O
orange O
trees O
, O
a O
large O
lake O
and O
Etna O
in O
background B-INCORRECT
. O

When O
I O
was O
a O
child O
, O
had O
lot O
friends O
and O
they O
were O
very O
important O
for B-INCORRECT
me O
. O

We O
ever B-INCORRECT
played O
in O
the O
park O
or O
we O
talked O
about O
our O
tastes O
, O
music O
boys O
laugh B-INCORRECT
a O
lot O
of O
... O

But O
when O
I B-INCORRECT
was O
a O
teenager O
began O
to B-INCORRECT
live B-INCORRECT
situations O
that O
did O
not O
like O
it B-INCORRECT
, O
for O
instance O
the B-INCORRECT
girls O
said O
me B-INCORRECT
bad B-INCORRECT
things B-INCORRECT
or O
they O
talked O
about O
. O

In O
those O
years O
I B-INCORRECT
lived B-INCORRECT
the O
worst O
moments O
in B-INCORRECT
my O
life O
. O

I O
remember O
when B-INCORRECT
celebreted B-INCORRECT
my O
15th O
birthday O
, O
only O
one O
schoolmate O
wanted O
to O
come O
party O
; B-INCORRECT
think O
that O
this B-INCORRECT
day B-INCORRECT
was O
of O
the O
worst O
life O
. O

There B-INCORRECT
night O
I B-INCORRECT
cried O
because O
felt O
that O
have B-INCORRECT
not B-INCORRECT
got B-INCORRECT
any O
friends O
. O

However O
, O
my O
parents O
tried O
that B-INCORRECT
party O
was O
the O
best O
and O
they O
prepared O
for B-INCORRECT
me B-INCORRECT
a B-INCORRECT
special B-INCORRECT
birthday B-INCORRECT
invited O
all O
cousins O
together B-INCORRECT
went B-INCORRECT
to O
eat O
pizza O
gave B-INCORRECT
lot O
of O
presents O
. O

In B-INCORRECT
there B-INCORRECT
moment O
, O
I O
thought O
that O
my O
best O
friends O
was B-INCORRECT
parents O
and O
sister O
. O

I O
knew O
that O
they O
never B-INCORRECT
talk O
bad B-INCORRECT
about O
me O
. O

Now O
, O
my O
husband O
is O
best O
friend O
. O

He O
is O
the O
most O
important O
people B-INCORRECT
of B-INCORRECT
my O
life O
. O

He O
has O
ever B-INCORRECT
been O
with O
me O
. O

Also O
, O
he O
is O
very O
funny O
and O
I O
laugh O
a O
lot O
with O
him O
. O

Both B-INCORRECT
like O
to O
travel O
around O
the O
world O
and O
practise B-INCORRECT
some O
sports O
, O
for O
example O
tennis O
running O
or O
trekking O
. O

We O
like O
watching O
TV O
series O
and O
cooking O
several B-INCORRECT
desserts O
too B-INCORRECT
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
my O
best O
friends O
are O
family O
especially O
David O
husband O
. O

Life B-INCORRECT
of O
people O
around O
the O
globe O
is O
becoming O
busier O
and O
day O
by O
. O

A O
busy O
life O
always O
compell B-INCORRECT
to O
use O
the O
fastest O
and O
most O
convenient O
mode O
of O
transportation O
, O
which O
has O
made O
public O

the B-INCORRECT
tecnology B-INCORRECT
have B-INCORRECT
chanched B-INCORRECT
people O
's O
life B-INCORRECT
very B-INCORRECT
much.in B-INCORRECT
fact O
we B-INCORRECT
can O
think O
how O
different O
is B-INCORRECT
our B-INCORRECT
respect B-INCORRECT
either B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
parents O
or B-INCORRECT
grandparents O
life.for B-INCORRECT
example O
my B-INCORRECT
did O
n't O
whacth B-INCORRECT
on B-INCORRECT
tv B-INCORRECT
, O
because O
there O
was O
any O
world O
when O
they O
were O
young.but B-INCORRECT
it B-INCORRECT
alone B-INCORRECT
difference O
: O
at B-INCORRECT
mobilefone B-INCORRECT
computer B-INCORRECT
ed B-INCORRECT
least B-INCORRECT
internet.our B-INCORRECT
woundn't B-INCORRECT
imagine B-INCORRECT
a O
strange O
machine O
like O
in O
their O
. O

Although B-INCORRECT
the O
fact O
that O
personal O
vehicle B-INCORRECT
like O
car B-INCORRECT
now B-INCORRECT
is B-INCORRECT
popular O
, O
in O
future O
stance B-INCORRECT
of O
public O
transport O
still O
very B-INCORRECT
crucial O
. O

Nowaday B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
people O
use O
fossil O
fuel B-INCORRECT
as O
the B-INCORRECT
most O
important O
source O
of O
energy O
for O
travelling O
manufacturing O
this B-INCORRECT
does O
n't O
always O
maintain B-INCORRECT
at O
constant O
level O
but B-INCORRECT
someday O
it O
will O
be B-INCORRECT
run O
out O
. O

People O
must O
find O
ways O
to O
use O
other O
energy O
sources O
like O
nuclear O
electricity B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
wind O
power O
public B-INCORRECT
transportation O
such O
as O
electric B-INCORRECT
metro O
this O
kind O
of O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
governments O
will O
invest O
more O
in O
researching O
the O
usage B-INCORRECT
of O
these O
new O
types O
energy O
travelling B-INCORRECT
using O
public O
transport O
become O
much O
cheaper O
than O
personal B-INCORRECT
car O
. O

The O
range O
of O
public O
services O
will O
be O
expanded O
to O
remote O
areas O
, O
it B-INCORRECT
become B-INCORRECT
much O
more O
convenient O
. O

Commuting O
, B-INCORRECT
travelling O
using O
public O
services O
will O
be O
the O
first O
prior B-INCORRECT
choice B-INCORRECT
. O

In O
addition O
, B-INCORRECT
the O
population O
is O
increasing O
rapidly O
in B-INCORRECT
near O
future O
almost B-INCORRECT
cities O
world O
will O
become O
overcrowded O
It B-INCORRECT
lead O
to B-INCORRECT
many O
other O
problems O
be O
solved O
for B-INCORRECT
example O
traffic O
jams O
air O
pollution O
. O

In O
some O
perespectives B-INCORRECT
, O
these O
problems O
are O
led B-INCORRECT
by O
the O
over B-INCORRECT
- B-INCORRECT
using B-INCORRECT
of O
personal O
vehicle B-INCORRECT
. O

People O
will O
realise O
that O
using O
their O
own O
car O
is O
just O
to B-INCORRECT
waste B-INCORRECT
time O
for B-INCORRECT
traffic O
jams O
or O
gradually O
killing O
themselves O
breathing O
polluted O
air O
. O

So O
the O
best O
way O
for O
them O
to O
travel O
is O
public O
transpotations B-INCORRECT
. O

Each O
person O
should O
practice O
saving O
when B-INCORRECT
using O
any O
source O
of O
eneny B-INCORRECT
to O
protect O
his O
own O
live B-INCORRECT
. O

In O
conclusion O
, B-INCORRECT
investments O
on B-INCORRECT
developing O
public B-INCORRECT
transport O
will O
be O
increased O
considerably O
services B-INCORRECT
of B-INCORRECT
travelling B-INCORRECT
have O
a O
bright O
potential B-INCORRECT
and O
it B-INCORRECT
's B-INCORRECT
stance B-INCORRECT
in O
the O
future O
ca O

Hello O

plans O

to O
temple O
in O
the O
morning O
followed O
by O
lunch O
at O
hotel O
latter B-INCORRECT
evening O
beach O
. O

In O
conclusion O
it B-INCORRECT
is O
evident O
that O
because O
developing O
countries O
are O
facing O
political O
and B-INCORRECT
economic O
instability O
, O
migrants O
travel O
for O
better O
education O
prospects O
stable O
environment O
younger B-INCORRECT
generation O
to O
grow O
up O
. B-INCORRECT

effects O

that O

In B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
moment O
I O
visit B-INCORRECT
Secondary B-INCORRECT
modern O
school O
. O

I O
'm O
in O
grade O
8 O
. O

My O
life O
is O
difficult O
because O
I O
have O
to O
realize O
everything O
. O

For O
example O
there B-INCORRECT
are B-INCORRECT
girl O
she B-INCORRECT
is B-INCORRECT
in O
my O
class O
beautiful O
. O

I O
love O
her O
look O
. O

Her O
eyes O
looks B-INCORRECT
as B-INCORRECT
the O
sun O
. O

But O
she O
is B-INCORRECT
ignored B-INCORRECT
me O
. O

I O
hope O
can O
forget O
her O
. O

Run O
for O
your O
life O

My O
favourite O
sport O
is O
run B-INCORRECT
. O

I O
like O
to O
running B-INCORRECT
fast O
so B-INCORRECT
in O
fact O
that O
it O
feel B-INCORRECT
me B-INCORRECT
as O
if O
run B-INCORRECT
on O
air O
and O
the B-INCORRECT
feet O
do B-INCORRECT
not B-INCORRECT
hardly O
touch O
ground O
between O
strides O
. O

My O
favourite O
place O
to O
run O
is O
in O
the O
forest O
but B-INCORRECT
I O
like O
sportive O
too O
. O

I O
am B-INCORRECT
likeing B-INCORRECT
to O
feel O
the B-INCORRECT
ground O
under O
my O
feet O
is O
soft O
so B-INCORRECT
not B-INCORRECT
hard O
concrete O
of B-INCORRECT
footpaths O
in O
city B-INCORRECT
streets B-INCORRECT
. O

The O
bestest B-INCORRECT
advice O
I O
can O
giving B-INCORRECT
to O
someone O
who O
is O
starting B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
running O
slowly O
and O
not O
try O
run O
too O
fast O
but B-INCORRECT
then O
eventually O
build O
up O
week O
by O
so O
that O
every O
you B-INCORRECT
are O
a O
little O
more B-INCORRECT
further O
faster O
after B-INCORRECT
20 O
years O
will O
be O
an O
Olympic O
champion O
maybe O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
television O
can O
be O
educational O
. O
Whether O
you O
are O
watching O
the O
news O
or O
a O
show O
about O
World O
War O
One O

Of O
course O
, O
it O
's O
important O
to O
choose O
the O
right O
television O
shows O
. O

If O
you O
're O
watching O
Tom O
& O
Jerry O
, O
it O
hardly B-INCORRECT
will B-INCORRECT
have O
any O
educational O
value O
. O

Although O
one O
could O
argue O
that O
you O
can O
always O
learn O
something O
. O

A O
friend O
of O
mine O
recently O
explained O
that O
if O
a O
zombie O
apokalyspe B-INCORRECT
should O
happen O
he B-INCORRECT
would O
be O
prepared O
because O
has O
been O
watching O
Walking O
Dead O
for O
some O
time O
now O
- O
so O
in O
his O
eyes O
, O
learned O
how O
( O
not O
) O
to O
act O
case O
. O

today B-INCORRECT
I O
want O
to O
write O
about O
my O
job O
. O

I O
'm O
a O
forensic O
biologist O
and O
deeply O
love O
my O
job O
. O

It O
is O
a O
job O
with O
lot O
of O
interesting O
aspects O
, B-INCORRECT

It O
is O
dynamic O
, O
stimulating O
and O
even O
if O
it O
not O
well O
remunerated O
I O
feel O
myself B-INCORRECT
satisfied O
. O

In O
the O
last O
few O
years O
forensic B-INCORRECT
biology O
has O
developed O
many O
aspects O
like O
better O
sensibility B-INCORRECT
, O
robustness O
of O
results O
and O
less O
time O
required O
for O
analyze B-INCORRECT
a O
sample O
but O
what O
struck O
me O
most O
is O
how O
fast O
this O
change O
happens B-INCORRECT
. O

Television O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
controversial O
tool O
. O

Here O
there O
is O
one O
: O
do B-INCORRECT
television O
offer O
highly O
likely O
opportunities O
for O
the O
audience O
in O
an O
educational O
way O
? O

From O
my O
experience O
knowledge B-INCORRECT
, O
I O
believe O
television O
cover B-INCORRECT
both O
entertaining B-INCORRECT
and O
educational O
functions O
. O

It O
notes O
how O
many O
educational O
programmes O
broaden O
young O
children O
's O
horizons O
in O
the O
past O
few O
years O
, O
quickly O
an O
adult O
learn B-INCORRECT
different O
basics O
from O
a O
great O
deal B-INCORRECT
number O
of O
such O
as O
cooking O
science O
and O
technology O
. O

It O
also O
notes O
educational O
programmes O
make O
a O
decision O
on O
what O
citizens O
should O
know O
in O
the O
future O
and O
knowledge O
our O
next O
generations O
are O
required O
to O
possess O
. O

Apart O
from O
eduational B-INCORRECT
contents B-INCORRECT
, O
there O
are B-INCORRECT
so O
many B-INCORRECT
foul B-INCORRECT
business O
advertisements O
and O
fake O
information O
on O
TV O
that O
citizens O
wo O
n't O
be O
able O
to O
tell O
right O
wrong O
. O

However O
, O
I O
believe O
the O
educational O
programmes O
on O
TV O
still O
plays B-INCORRECT
a O
vital O
role O
in O
educating O
both O
adults O
and O
young O
children O
. O

I O
think O
who B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
best O
restaurant B-INCORRECT
where B-INCORRECT
we O
can O
go O
is B-INCORRECT
" O
sailor B-INCORRECT
's O

Here B-INCORRECT
we O
can O
eat O
typical O
Italian O
food O
. O

The O
last O
time O
who B-INCORRECT
I O
was O
here B-INCORRECT
have B-INCORRECT
eat B-INCORRECT
the O
best O
pizza O
that O
ever O
in O
my O
life O
. O

The O
atmosphere O
remind B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
theme B-INCORRECT
of O
sea O
in B-INCORRECT
fact O
walls O
are O
decorating B-INCORRECT
with O
a O
lot O
shell B-INCORRECT
and O
waiters O
dressed O
like O
sailors O
: O
I O
think O
that O
it O
's O
great O
idea O
! O

Also O
, O
It B-INCORRECT
's O
perfect O
for O
our O
class O
because O
there O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
space O
so B-INCORRECT
we O
can O
sit O
all O
together O
at O
the O
same O
table O
. O

the B-INCORRECT
owner O
is O
a O
very O
kind O
person O
and O
I O
'm O
sure O
who B-INCORRECT
he O
makes B-INCORRECT
us O
convenience B-INCORRECT
price O
. O

No O
future O
for O
public O
transport O
? O

Public O
transport O
is O
the O
cheaper O
way O
of O
travel B-INCORRECT
, O
so O
it O
has O
future B-INCORRECT
. O

Currently O
, B-INCORRECT
most O
people O
is B-INCORRECT
used O
to O
use B-INCORRECT
their O
own O
car O
get O
work O
or O
go O
shopping O
due O
it O
more O
comfortable O
. O

But O
cars O
pollute O
the B-INCORRECT
air O
with O
CO2 O
emissions O
every O
day O
and O
contribute O
to O
climate O
change O
. O

So O
, O
if O
people O
were O
aware O
of O
this O
subject O
would B-INCORRECT
n't O
use O
so B-INCORRECT
much B-INCORRECT
their B-INCORRECT
own B-INCORRECT
car B-INCORRECT
. O

In O
addition O
, O
having O
a O
car O
is O
very O
expensive O
. O

First O
of O
all O
you B-INCORRECT
need O
can B-INCORRECT
afford O
to O
buy O
it O
, B-INCORRECT
after B-INCORRECT
that O
must O
pay O
for O
the O
asurance B-INCORRECT
council B-INCORRECT
tax O
and O
mechanic O
bills B-INCORRECT
so O
on O
. O

whereas B-INCORRECT
in B-INCORRECT
a B-INCORRECT
public O
transport O
, B-INCORRECT
you O
only O
have O
to O
pay O
the B-INCORRECT
ticket O
do O
n't O
drive O
and B-INCORRECT
if O
bus O
or O
train O
whatever O
vehicle O
use O
breacks B-INCORRECT
down O
it B-INCORRECT
is O
your O
responsibility O
. O

Besides O
, O
public O
transport O
pollute B-INCORRECT
less O
than O
cars O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
think O
public O
transport O
has O
future B-INCORRECT
and O
the O
more O
people O
use O
it O
will B-INCORRECT
have O
. O

I O
'm O
your O
employee O
, O
to B-INCORRECT
serve B-INCORRECT
on B-INCORRECT
company O
. O

Very O
pleased O
to O
be O
able O
receive O
your O
salary O
payment O
. O

But O
pay B-INCORRECT
a B-INCORRECT
little O
low O
. O

I O
completed O
many O
tasks O
, B-INCORRECT
including O
tutoring O
three O
students O
complete B-INCORRECT
summer O
homework O
correcting O
diligently B-INCORRECT
assist B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
instructor B-INCORRECT
helped B-INCORRECT
organize O
handouts O
instead O
of O
to B-INCORRECT
answer O
questions O
raised O
by O
but O
also O
clean B-INCORRECT
classroom O
hygiene B-INCORRECT
very O
hard O
have O
nothing O
complain O
about O
. O

I O
work O
hard O
for O
two O
months O
, O
pay O
a O
lot O
. O

Just B-INCORRECT
your O
wage O
paid O
too B-INCORRECT
much O
lower O
than O
I O
expected O
, B-INCORRECT
want O
a O
little O
higher O
wages O
payment O
of O
300 O
yuan O
more O
the O
existing O
basis O
. O

I O
invite O
you O
to O
consider O
the O
proposal O
. O

I O
think O
about B-INCORRECT
transport B-INCORRECT
that O
the B-INCORRECT
government O
has B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
help O
public O
, O
for O
example O
bus B-INCORRECT
train B-INCORRECT
metro B-INCORRECT
and O
more O
only B-INCORRECT
one B-INCORRECT
reason O
: O
quality O
of O
life O
against O
pollution O
. O

Travelling O
by O
car O
is O
more O
convenient O
in O
a O
lot O
of O
situation B-INCORRECT
, O
but O
it O
could O
be O
annoying O
for B-INCORRECT
search O
parking B-INCORRECT
and B-INCORRECT
cost B-INCORRECT
fuel O
also O
maintenance O
. O

In O
big O
cities O
public B-INCORRECT
transport O
works O
well O
because O
there O
's O
a B-INCORRECT
good O
feedback O
by B-INCORRECT
people O
. O

Instead B-INCORRECT
in O
the B-INCORRECT
small O
cities B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
it B-INCORRECT
ca O
n't O
be O
good O
same O
way O
because O
for B-INCORRECT
transport O
companies O
's O
not O
convenient O
invest B-INCORRECT
money O
fewer O
people O
would O
use O
. O

Tom O
Sawyer O
was O
a O
boy O
that O
lived O
with O
his O
aunt O
Polly O
and O
she O
had O
to O
punish O
because B-INCORRECT
sometimes O
did O
n't O
go O
school O
. O

On O
Monday O
Tom B-INCORRECT
went B-INCORRECT
walking O
to O
school O
and O
he O
saw O
his O
friend O
Huck O
which B-INCORRECT
they O
talk B-INCORRECT
a O
lot O
exchanged O
tick O
for O
tooth O
. O

Then O
he O
saw O
a O
beautiful O
girl O
named O
Becky O
so B-INCORRECT
Tom O
talk B-INCORRECT
to O
her O
at O
school O
and O
they O
went O
into O
secret O
garden O
kissed O
. O

Tom O
say B-INCORRECT
to O
her O
of B-INCORRECT
another O
girl O
so B-INCORRECT
she O
got O
mad O
and O
ignored O
. O

Tom O
was O
so B-INCORRECT
sad O
because O
Becky O
did O
n't O
to O
talk O
with B-INCORRECT
him O
went O
on O
a O
trip O
Huck O
and O
disappeared O
for O
weeks O
. O

When O
Tom O
saw O
his O
house O
he B-INCORRECT
sneak B-INCORRECT
into O
and O
aunt O
Polly O
crying O
for O
him O
. O

So O
the B-INCORRECT
next O
day O
people O
of O
town O
went O
to O
church O
hear B-INCORRECT
funeral O
Tom O
because B-INCORRECT
many O
thought O
that O
was O
dead O
but B-INCORRECT
suddenly O
open B-INCORRECT
door O
and O
got B-INCORRECT
in O
so B-INCORRECT
everybody O
surprised O
see O
. O

The O
next O
day O
Huck B-INCORRECT
went O
to O
Tom O
's O
house O
tell O
him O
that O
there O
is B-INCORRECT
an O
abandoned O
up O
the O
hill O
so B-INCORRECT
two O
boys O
considered O
like O
andventure B-INCORRECT
. O

So O
they O
went O
to O
the O
misterious B-INCORRECT
house O
and O
when O
were O
inside O
heard O
voices O
so B-INCORRECT
Tom O
Huck O
hide B-INCORRECT
saw O
that O
Injuin O
Joe O
was O
one O
talking O
. O

the B-INCORRECT
two O
boys O
heard O
that O
he O
was O
planing B-INCORRECT
to O
steal O
some O
money O
and O
kill O
people O
so B-INCORRECT
start B-INCORRECT
their O

on B-INCORRECT
stoping B-INCORRECT
Injuin O
Joe O

restaurant O

izakaya O
. O

That O
is O
because O

will O
improve O
your O
Japanese O
skill B-INCORRECT
in B-INCORRECT
them B-INCORRECT
. O

Recently O
, O
many O
south O
East B-INCORRECT
Asians O
have O
studied O
Japanese O
in O
Japan O
while O
working O
them O
. O

By O
improving O
their O
Japanese O
skills O
, B-INCORRECT
in O
Japan O
they B-INCORRECT
have O
the O
opportunity O
to O
get O
a O
job O
. O

Michael O
closed O
the O

at O
that O
moment O
he O

made O
a O
mistake O
. O

He O
was O
at O
Sarah O

house O
when O
suddenly O
he O
left O

he O
went O
back O
to B-INCORRECT
Sarah O

clean B-INCORRECT
all B-INCORRECT

Hi O
Julie O

located O
in O
the O
centre O
of O
city O
Bangalore O

India O

My O
school O
has O
a O
unique O
reputation O
for O
their B-INCORRECT
friendliness O
and O
the O
quality O
of O
education O
. O

I O
like O
my O
maths O
teacher O
very O
much O
because O
her O
teaching O
style O
is O
realistic O
and O
simple O
to O
understanad B-INCORRECT
. O

Good O
Morning O
: O

This O
is B-INCORRECT
an O
esay O
about O
my O
favourite O
sport O
, B-INCORRECT
it B-INCORRECT
swimming B-INCORRECT
since O
I B-INCORRECT
was O
a B-INCORRECT
child O
because B-INCORRECT
always B-INCORRECT
enjoy O
lot O
and O
what B-INCORRECT
more O
can O
do O
alone O
never O
refuse B-INCORRECT
to O
go O
pool O
less O
in O
summer O
of O
course O
. O

I B-INCORRECT
do O
n't O
have O
friends O
who O
like O
swimming O
, B-INCORRECT
almost B-INCORRECT
football O
or B-INCORRECT
similar O
teams B-INCORRECT
sports O
and B-INCORRECT
always B-INCORRECT
go O
alone O
it B-INCORRECT
is O
boring O
for O
me O
furthermore B-INCORRECT
prefer O
going O
because O
anybody B-INCORRECT
bother B-INCORRECT
haven't B-INCORRECT
wait O
. O

I B-INCORRECT
said O
that O
because O
when O
was O
eleven O
my O
best O
friend O
had O
been B-INCORRECT
operated B-INCORRECT
on O
her O
back O
and O
before B-INCORRECT
the O
operation O
he B-INCORRECT
came O
with O
me O
every B-INCORRECT
day O
to O
wait O
for O
she O
spendt B-INCORRECT
a O
lot O
of O
time O
in O
shower O
cleaning O
long O
hais B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
hated O
! O

Luckily O
the B-INCORRECT
operation O
was O
fine O
and O
she O
left B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
come B-INCORRECT
with O
me O
, O
since O
that O
day O
I B-INCORRECT
go O
for B-INCORRECT
my O
own O
. O

Swim B-INCORRECT
is O
a B-INCORRECT
relaxing O
exercise O
for O
me O
and O
normally O
there O
are O
n't O
many O
people O
in O
the O
pool O
, B-INCORRECT
but B-INCORRECT
sometimes O
children O
I O
do O
like O
so B-INCORRECT
much O
because O
they O
disturbing O
it O
amusing O
too B-INCORRECT
. O

I O
would O
recommended O
to B-INCORRECT
people O
who O
not B-INCORRECT
know O
swim B-INCORRECT
learn O
, O
because O
am O
pretty O
sure O
that O
it B-INCORRECT
like B-INCORRECT
and O
later O
they O
can O
stop O
. O

I O
think O
that O
dance O
is O
a O
way B-INCORRECT
for B-INCORRECT
self O
- O
expression O
. O

It O
's O
not O
just O
a O
hobby O
, B-INCORRECT
it O
more O
than O
this B-INCORRECT
. O

Dance O
is O
a O
passion O
, O
type B-INCORRECT
of O
life O
. O

When O
I O
'm O
dancing O
forget O
all O
my O
problems O
, O
except O
stupids B-INCORRECT
companions O
that O
they B-INCORRECT
do O
n't O
understand O
anything O
. O

But O
this O
is O
another O
theme O
for O
speaking O
. O

When O
you B-INCORRECT
dance O
, O
sing O
or O
act O
are O
showing O
something O
to O
the O
public O
that O
's O
important O
por B-INCORRECT
. O

If O
dance O
is O
your O
passion O
, O
you O
practise B-INCORRECT
every O
day O
and O
'll O
keep O
all O
the B-INCORRECT
days B-INCORRECT
until O
can O
. O

If O
you O
are O
tired O
does B-INCORRECT
n't O
matters B-INCORRECT
, O
because O
like O
that B-INCORRECT
're O
doing O
. O

You O
'll O
wake O
up O
early O
for B-INCORRECT
going B-INCORRECT
dance B-INCORRECT
, O
or O
do B-INCORRECT
classes O
. O

You O
do O
n't O
matter B-INCORRECT
if O
you O
go O
to O
sleep O
late O
, O
or O
... O

That O
's O
a O
joke O
, B-INCORRECT
you B-INCORRECT
must O
sleep O
. O

If O
you O
love O
dance O
, O
'll O
understand O
me O
. O

Another O
thing O
that O
you O

it B-INCORRECT

how O
to O
deal O
with O
people O
, B-INCORRECT
we B-INCORRECT
are O
searching O
for O
someone O
who O
can O
impress O

. O

That O

all O
, O

kisses O
, O

Fer O

we B-INCORRECT
think O
that O
in O
the O
future O
planet O
will O
be B-INCORRECT
bad B-INCORRECT
conditions B-INCORRECT
and O
trees O
dissappearing B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
after B-INCORRECT
having B-INCORRECT
wars O
. O

In O
30 O
years O
we B-INCORRECT
will O
have O
changed O
our O
anatomy O
, B-INCORRECT
also B-INCORRECT
be O
eating O
fast O
food O
on B-INCORRECT
the O
other O
hand O
north B-INCORRECT
pole B-INCORRECT
melted O
totally B-INCORRECT
. O

The O
temperature O
will O
have B-INCORRECT
become O
crazy O
by B-INCORRECT
global O
warming O
, O
so O
some O
people O
died B-INCORRECT
because O
the B-INCORRECT
natural O
disasters O
be O
more O
aggressive O
. O

The B-INCORRECT
Technology O
will O
have O
advanced O
and O
maybe O
the B-INCORRECT
cars O
be B-INCORRECT
flying B-INCORRECT
by B-INCORRECT
streets O
computers O
totally O
changed O
. O

Because O
of O
this O
, O
we B-INCORRECT
have O
to O
raise O
awareness O
what O
is O
happening O
and O
help O
the O
planet O
. O

Friendship O
is O
something O
very O
important O
in O
my O
life O
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
imagine O
my O
lifetime B-INCORRECT
without O

How O
to O
make O
friends O
and O
meet O
new O
people O
? O

It O
is O
easyier B-INCORRECT
than O
you O
think O
. O

Just O
... O
start O
talking O
! O

Communication O
is O
the O
most O
important O
point O
when O
you O
're O
going O
to O
make O
friends O
. O

You O
have O
to O
remember O
, O
that O
friends O
are O
not O
supposed O
agree O
on O
every O
single O
thing O
. O

They O
just O
have O
to O
calm B-INCORRECT
talk O
about O
it O
. O

If O
your O
friendship O
is O
real O
, O
you O
will O
always O
find O
point B-INCORRECT
between O
opinion O
and O
friend O

Just O

But O
some O

very O
rude O
and O
their O

Recently O
I O
saw O
the O
thriller O
of O
mokingjay B-INCORRECT
part O
2 O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
see O
that O
movie O
, O
need O
watch O
the O
first O
3 O
movies O
before O
understand O
it O
. O

The O
first O
movies O
, B-INCORRECT
were O
amazing O
! O

A O
lot O
of O
action O
, O
drama O
and O
romance O
. O

The O
fans O
of O
this O
series O
, B-INCORRECT
had O
been O
wanting B-INCORRECT
for O
movie O
science B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
first O
appeared O
that B-INCORRECT
was O
in O
2012 O
. O

I B-INCORRECT
do O
n't O
think B-INCORRECT
that O
this O
movie O
is B-INCORRECT
for O
all O
the O
family O
, B-INCORRECT
because O
hard O
little O
kids O
to O
understand O
in B-INCORRECT
opinion O
more O
a B-INCORRECT
teen O
. O

I O
think O
people O
will O
like O
this B-INCORRECT
movie B-INCORRECT
because O
, B-INCORRECT
its B-INCORRECT
very O
similar O
to O
the B-INCORRECT
story O
of O
book O
; B-INCORRECT
one O
first O
that O
is O
really O
based O
in B-INCORRECT
theme O
unique O
and O
original O
also B-INCORRECT
actors O
movies O
were O
perfect O
last O
they O
put B-INCORRECT
double O
effort B-INCORRECT
. O

Hope O
you O
guys O
choose O
this O
movie O
! O

It O
will O
be O
very O
cool O
to O
see O
the O
las B-INCORRECT
part O
mokingjay B-INCORRECT
! O

my B-INCORRECT
favourite O
sport O
is O
Karate O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
I O
enjoy O
it O
because O
when O
practise O
feel O
can O
hold O
on O
for O
hours O
. O

When O
I B-INCORRECT
've O
had O
a O
very O
bad O
and O
stressful O
day O
can O
relax O
doing O
karate O
, O
because O
It B-INCORRECT
's O
the O
kind O
of O
sport O
that O
it B-INCORRECT
is O
n't O
hard O
. O

Training O
Karate B-INCORRECT
is O
a O
way O
to O
forget O
your O
problems O
, O
tiring O
routine O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
it O
's O
very O
difficult O
to O
fnd B-INCORRECT
this O
advantage O
with O
others B-INCORRECT
sports O
. O

Apart O
from O
that O
, B-INCORRECT
Karate O
it B-INCORRECT
's B-INCORRECT
not O
just O
a O
sport O
is B-INCORRECT
also O
discipline O
teach B-INCORRECT
you O
respect O
balance O
even B-INCORRECT
culture O
. O

my B-INCORRECT
teacher O
show B-INCORRECT
us O
how O
we O
have B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
behave O
with O
others O
and O
he O
teach B-INCORRECT
a O
lot O
of O
things O
about O
the B-INCORRECT
japanese B-INCORRECT
culture O
. O

for B-INCORRECT
someone O
who O
starts B-INCORRECT
Karate O
is B-INCORRECT
easy O
to O
follow O
the O
class O
, O
so O
my O
advice O
just O
not O
get O
nervous O
and O
be O
concentrated O
on O
what O
he O
or O
she O
doing O
. O

Technology O
, B-INCORRECT
is O
something O
that O
very O
important O
without O
which O
we O
can O
not O
live O
. O

Today O
topic B-INCORRECT
is O
Technology O
. O

Nowadays O
we B-INCORRECT
use O
technology O
in B-INCORRECT
every B-INCORRECT
thing B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
from O
educations B-INCORRECT
to O
making O
clothes O
everyday B-INCORRECT
and O
everywhere O
. O

Technology O
is O
always O
upgrading B-INCORRECT
and O
it O
very O
helpful O
, O
useful O
important O
for O
development O
but B-INCORRECT
todays B-INCORRECT
generation O
influenced O
whit B-INCORRECT
technology O
that B-INCORRECT
they O
have O
stopped O
to B-INCORRECT
do B-INCORRECT
other O
activities O
. O

Last O
year O
, B-INCORRECT
My B-INCORRECT
friend O
Michael O
was O
at O
school O
when O
he B-INCORRECT
heard O
about O
a O
short O
story O
competition O
liked O
the O
idea O
so B-INCORRECT
decided O
to O
enter O
. O

but O
there O
was O
a O
fees B-INCORRECT
in O
order O
to O
join B-INCORRECT
the O
competition O
, B-INCORRECT
he B-INCORRECT
had O
no O
money O
. B-INCORRECT
fortunately B-INCORRECT
have B-INCORRECT
lot O
of O
friends O
they B-INCORRECT
can O
lent B-INCORRECT
him O

he B-INCORRECT
phoned O
me O
and O
asked O
to O
lent B-INCORRECT
him O
some O
money O
register O
the B-INCORRECT
competition O
. O

he B-INCORRECT
took O
the O
money O
second B-INCORRECT
day O
, B-INCORRECT
finished O
registration O
and O
started O
in B-INCORRECT
writing O
story O
after B-INCORRECT
long B-INCORRECT
time B-INCORRECT
spending B-INCORRECT
did B-INCORRECT
good O
job O
went O
to O
give O
his O
international O
student O
magazine O
office O
found O
out O
there O
are B-INCORRECT
a B-INCORRECT
notice O
on O
door O
say B-INCORRECT
that O
competition O
has B-INCORRECT
canceled O
came O
back O
vey B-INCORRECT
sad O
told O
me O
what O
happened B-INCORRECT
.Michael B-INCORRECT
closed O
knew O
at O
moment O
had O
mistake O
. O

Travelling O
by O
car O
is O
n't O
so B-INCORRECT
much O
more O
convenient O
unless O
it O
comfortable O
, O
but O
actually O
we O
do O
think O
about O
the O
contamination B-INCORRECT
in B-INCORRECT
our O
planet O
. O

Travelling O
by O
bus O
is O
very O
stressful O
because O
the O
people O
push O
me O
or O
I O
ca O
n't O
sit O
down O
there O
are O
any O
chair B-INCORRECT
for O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
in O
future O
maybe B-INCORRECT
would B-INCORRECT
have O
a O
bus O
which O
having B-INCORRECT
chair B-INCORRECT
for O
everybody O
and O
I O
do B-INCORRECT
n't O
to O
stand O
up O
. O

Other B-INCORRECT
transport B-INCORRECT
public B-INCORRECT
is O
the O
taxi O
like B-INCORRECT
car B-INCORRECT
, O
it O
so B-INCORRECT
more O
comfortable O
too O
but B-INCORRECT
expensive O
than O
bus B-INCORRECT
or O
train O
. O

The O
AVE O
or O
aeroplane O
are B-INCORRECT
a O
good O
option O
for O
long O
trip B-INCORRECT
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
in O
the O
future O
should B-INCORRECT
have O
a B-INCORRECT
bus B-INCORRECT
so B-INCORRECT
more B-INCORRECT
comfortable B-INCORRECT
. O

Dear O
sir B-INCORRECT
Dimara O
. B-INCORRECT

I O
am O
writing O
about O
a O
problem O
at B-INCORRECT
my O
city O
. O

I O
live O
at B-INCORRECT
Patras O
a B-INCORRECT
big O
city O
in O
Greece O
. O

in B-INCORRECT
my O
city O
all B-INCORRECT
schools B-INCORRECT
and O
some O
walls O
of B-INCORRECT
buildings O
are O
full B-INCORRECT
drawings O
writing O
. O

The O
vandalisme B-INCORRECT
in O
patras B-INCORRECT
has O
increased O
a O
lot O
. O

Unfortunately O
when B-INCORRECT
we O
say B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
somebody O
do B-INCORRECT
not B-INCORRECT
draw O
the B-INCORRECT
walls O
but B-INCORRECT
they O
hear O
us O
. O

For B-INCORRECT
our B-INCORRECT
city B-INCORRECT
it B-INCORRECT
is B-INCORRECT
very B-INCORRECT
bad B-INCORRECT
because O
when O
some O
new O
people O
visit O
Patras O
they O
see O
that B-INCORRECT
thing B-INCORRECT
. O

Patras O
is O
a O
very O
beautiful O
city O
and B-INCORRECT
for B-INCORRECT
her B-INCORRECT
culture O
, O
monuments O
. O

Why O
to O
see O
that O
abaser O
thing O
? O

After B-INCORRECT
we B-INCORRECT
have O
this O
beautiful O
city O
to O
maintain O
her B-INCORRECT
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
the B-INCORRECT
police O
should O
stop O
Vandalisme B-INCORRECT
. O

If O
it B-INCORRECT
have B-INCORRECT
police O
all O
around O
the O
city O
nobody B-INCORRECT
will B-INCORRECT
dare O
to O
do O
a B-INCORRECT
graffiti O
or O
write O
something O
draw O
. O

I O
hope O
you O
will O
do O
something O
for B-INCORRECT
that O
problem O
. O

Yours O
faithfully B-INCORRECT
, O

Jessyka O

All O
around O
the O
world O
pupils O
are O
waiting O
for B-INCORRECT
finishing B-INCORRECT
school O
. O

They O
are O
eager O
to O
begin O
a O
new O
life O
as O
adults O
. O

But O
when O
they O
reach O
in B-INCORRECT
- O
between O
period O
, O
confused O
feelings O
cross O
their O
minds O
. O

As O
a O
rule O
after B-INCORRECT
last B-INCORRECT
exams O
they B-INCORRECT
do O
n't O
know O
what O
university O
to O
choose O
. O

What O
they O
will O
do O
in O
future O
see O
, B-INCORRECT
like B-INCORRECT
a O
fogg B-INCORRECT
. O

In O
this B-INCORRECT
way B-INCORRECT
, O
idea B-INCORRECT
of O
a O
year O
off O
between O
leaving O
school O
and O
starting O
next B-INCORRECT
education O
is O
very O
reasonable O
. O

Firstly O
it B-INCORRECT
'll O
allow O
young O
people O
to O
have O
a O
rest O
after O
the O
first O
hard O
- O
work O
studying O
period O
. O

Ten O
or O
eleven O
years O
at O
school O
make B-INCORRECT
them O
tired O
, O
in B-INCORRECT
spite B-INCORRECT
of B-INCORRECT
pupils O
do O
n't O
notice O
it O
. O

But O
choosing O
the B-INCORRECT
second B-INCORRECT
education O
is O
very B-INCORRECT
important O
step O
, O
which O
need B-INCORRECT
serious O
attitude O
. O

Secondly O
such B-INCORRECT
year B-INCORRECT
off O
would O
give O
to B-INCORRECT
future O
students O
a O
chance O
try O
themselves O
in B-INCORRECT
new O
professional O
sphears B-INCORRECT
. O

Also O
they B-INCORRECT
would O
have O
an O
opprtunity B-INCORRECT
being B-INCORRECT
involved O
in O
volontier B-INCORRECT
activity B-INCORRECT
. O

And O
thirdly O
they B-INCORRECT
might O
work O
for B-INCORRECT
earning B-INCORRECT
own O
money O
or O
travel O
. O

This O
year O
holiday B-INCORRECT
would O
be O
really O
helpful O
for O
relaxation O
and O
gettin B-INCORRECT
new O
power B-INCORRECT
future B-INCORRECT
education O
. O

One O
year O
is O
not O
long B-INCORRECT
period B-INCORRECT
. O

But O
benefits B-INCORRECT
after O
year B-INCORRECT
off O
will O
be O
obvious O
. O

I O
live O
in B-INCORRECT
San O
Miguel O
Almoloyan O
, B-INCORRECT
this B-INCORRECT
is O
a O
village O
the B-INCORRECT
municipality O
of B-INCORRECT
Almoloya O
de O
Juarez O
State O
Mexico O
care B-INCORRECT
environment O
very O
important O
and O
my O
they O
take O
different O
actions O
. O

People O
collects B-INCORRECT
trash B-INCORRECT
of B-INCORRECT
their B-INCORRECT
house B-INCORRECT
and O
await O
the O
truck O
that O
carried B-INCORRECT
to O
a O
landfill O
located O
outside O
village O
. O

Also O
, O
people O
go O
out O
to O
collect O
the O
trash O
that O
there O
is O
on B-INCORRECT
kiosk O
church O
or O
in O
principal O
places O
village O
. O

. B-INCORRECT

It O
would O
be O
useful O
if O
I O
can B-INCORRECT
live O
with O
other O
students O
, O
because O
it B-INCORRECT
is O
a O
good O
way O
to O
learning B-INCORRECT
language O
as O
well O
. O

Lastly B-INCORRECT
, O
Let B-INCORRECT
me O

you O
. O

Yours O

Rosa O

Peter O
looked O
at O
his O
watch O

knew O
that O

had O
to O
do O
something O
immediately O
, B-INCORRECT
after O

of O

They O
are B-INCORRECT
planning O
to O
rob B-INCORRECT
a O
very O
precious O
thing O

. O

He O
does B-INCORRECT
n't O
have O
much O
time O
to O
prove O
their O
plan O
and O
he O
could O
not O
wait O
let B-INCORRECT
it O
happen O
. O

It O
is O
his O
town B-INCORRECT
and O
it O
duty O
too O
to O

. O

He O
called O
the O

plan O
. O

Police B-INCORRECT
reached O
Museum B-INCORRECT
and O
caught O
robbers B-INCORRECT
red O

Hello O
Estela O
! O

How O
are O
you O
? O
I O
hope O
well O
. O

I O
'm O
writing O
because O
tell B-INCORRECT
you O
about O
my O
last O
summer O
holiday O
. O

I O
went O
to O
Las O
Hurdes O
. O

I O
stayed O
about O
one O
week O
in O
the O
home O
my B-INCORRECT
boyfriend O
. O

I O
had B-INCORRECT
a O
wedding O
. O

While O
I O
was O
there O
, O
did O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
. O

One O
day O
, O
I O
visited O
Meandro O
del O
melero O
. O

It O
was O
beautiful O
. O

And O
there O
was O
a O
wonderful O
view O
. O

The B-INCORRECT
other B-INCORRECT
day O
, O
I O
walked O
a O
lot O
and O
the B-INCORRECT
end O
way B-INCORRECT
we O
found O
waterfall O
. O

The O
name O
of O
waterfall B-INCORRECT
was O
Chorrituelo O
. O

It O
was O
spectacular O
. O

The B-INCORRECT
wedding B-INCORRECT
day B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
I B-INCORRECT
had B-INCORRECT
a B-INCORRECT
great B-INCORRECT
time B-INCORRECT
and O
slept O
very O
late O
. O

The O
wedding O
was O
in O
the B-INCORRECT
morning O
, O
and O
at B-INCORRECT
afternoon O
we O
ate O
restaurant O
with O
other O
people O
. O

However O
, B-INCORRECT
in O
the O
night O
we O
had O
dinner O
a O
garaje O
and O
there O
was O
party O
all O
. O

You O
should O
visit O
Las O
Hurdes O
, O
It O
is O
a O
beautiful O
site B-INCORRECT
. O

And O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
. B-INCORRECT

And O
the O
people O
are O
very O
nice O
. O

English O
is O
an O
international O
language O
which O
becomes B-INCORRECT
important O
for O
the O
modern O
world O
. O

In O
China O
, O
English O
is O
took O
to O
be O
a O
foreign O
language O
which O
many O
students O
choose O
learn O
. O

They O
begin O
to O
study O
English O
at O
an O
early O
age O
. O

They O
use B-INCORRECT
at O
least O
one O
hour O
to B-INCORRECT
learn B-INCORRECT
English O
knowledge B-INCORRECT
a B-INCORRECT
day O
. O

Even O
kids O
in O
kindergarten O
have O
begun O
learning O
simple O
words O
. O

That O
's O
a O
good O
phenomenon O
, O
for B-INCORRECT
English O
is O
essential O
nowadays O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
, B-INCORRECT
some O
people O
think O
English O
is O
superior O
than B-INCORRECT
Chinese O
. O

In O
me B-INCORRECT
opinion O
, O
though O
English O
is B-INCORRECT
for B-INCORRECT
great O
significance O
but B-INCORRECT
after B-INCORRECT
all O
a B-INCORRECT
foreign O
language O
. O

it B-INCORRECT
is O
hard O
for O
people O
to O
see O
eye O
. O

English O
do B-INCORRECT
help O
us O
read O
original O
works O
, O
but O
Chinese O
helps O
learn O
a B-INCORRECT
true O
China O
. O

Only O
by O
characters O
Chinese O
literature B-INCORRECT
can B-INCORRECT
send O
off O
its O
brilliance O
. O

Learning B-INCORRECT
a O
country O
's O
culture O
, O
especial B-INCORRECT
its O
classic B-INCORRECT
the O
first O
thing O
is O
learn B-INCORRECT
language O
. O

Because O
of B-INCORRECT
we O
are O
Chinese O
, O
why O
do O
give O
up O
our B-INCORRECT
mother O
tongue O
and O
learn O
owne B-INCORRECT
culture O
through O
a O
foreign O
language O
? O

I B-INCORRECT
was B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
last B-INCORRECT
month B-INCORRECT
in B-INCORRECT
a O
fantastic O
restaurant O
Woolypools O
. O

It O
is O
small O
but O
comfortable O
and O
famous O
for O
his B-INCORRECT
big O
burguers O
. O

Woolypools O
is O
a O
speciallist B-INCORRECT
of O
meal O
, O
it O
's O
restaurant O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
the B-INCORRECT
restaurant O
can B-INCORRECT
be O
better O
, O
respect B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
meat O
but O
it O
is O
perfect O
have B-INCORRECT
dinner O
with O
your O
friends O
. O

I O
have B-INCORRECT
expects B-INCORRECT
to O
be O
more O
famous O
, O
better O
and O
biggest B-INCORRECT
. O

The O
problem O
of B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
restaurant O
is O
place B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
it B-INCORRECT
far O
from O
people O
and O
cities O
space O
that B-INCORRECT
very O
small O
for O
lots O
. O

In O
this O
life O
we O
have O
many O
things O
that O
make O
us O
happy O
and O
our O
lives O
go O
on O
. O

for B-INCORRECT
example O
, O
a O
present O
or O
gift O
especially B-INCORRECT
if O
it O
from B-INCORRECT
your O
best O
friend O
. O

Once O
, O
I O
got O
sick O
and O
stayed O
at B-INCORRECT
general O
hospital O
my O
friend O
gave O
me O
a O
flower O
. O

It O
was O
my O
favorite O
flower O
I B-INCORRECT
have B-INCORRECT
it B-INCORRECT
ever B-INCORRECT
. O

In O
my O
town O
we O
create B-INCORRECT
a O
small O
organization O
for O
more B-INCORRECT
healthy O
environment O
, B-INCORRECT
beauty O
touch O
and O
to O
be O
attractive O
. O
the B-INCORRECT
citizens O
in B-INCORRECT
must O
participate O
this O
citizen B-INCORRECT
will B-INCORRECT
take O
responsibility O
specific B-INCORRECT
day O
clean O
put O
rubbish O
into B-INCORRECT
correct O
place O
tree B-INCORRECT
plant O
of O
it B-INCORRECT

I O
'm B-INCORRECT
agree O
with O
the B-INCORRECT
opinion O
that O
famous O
people O
, O
such O
as O
politicians O
and O
film O
stars O
deserve B-INCORRECT
to O
have O
a O
private O
life O
without O
journalists O
following O
them O
all O
time O
. O

is B-INCORRECT
horrible O
have B-INCORRECT
a O
person O
behind O
you O
all O
the O
time O
, B-INCORRECT
not B-INCORRECT
life O
peace O
happy O
. O

In O
adition B-INCORRECT
all O
pearsons B-INCORRECT
have O
the O
right O
to O
privacy O
and O
be O
free O
. O

Nevertheless O
the B-INCORRECT
journalists O
stay B-INCORRECT
all O
time O
having B-INCORRECT
a B-INCORRECT
photo B-INCORRECT
, O
when O
they O
eaten B-INCORRECT
drinking O
happy O
sad O
how O
is O
your B-INCORRECT
love O
life O
and O
with B-INCORRECT
whoever B-INCORRECT
if O
something O
important O
our B-INCORRECT
what O
buy B-INCORRECT
. O

This O
is O
terrible O
, B-INCORRECT
you B-INCORRECT
do O
not O
have B-INCORRECT
privacy O
authought B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
society O
a B-INCORRECT
blame O
because O
if O
they O
take O
photo O
our B-INCORRECT
follows B-INCORRECT
life B-INCORRECT
of O
famous O
people O
bored B-INCORRECT
. O

So O
that B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
politicians O
and O
film O
stars O

Once O
upon O
a O
time O
was B-INCORRECT
one B-INCORRECT
little O
ant O
called O
Penny O
, B-INCORRECT
he B-INCORRECT
really O
small O
in B-INCORRECT
compared O
with O
the O
others O
. O

He O
hated O
to B-INCORRECT
be B-INCORRECT
like O
that O
because O
most O
of O
the O
ants O
made O
fun O
him O
until B-INCORRECT
one O
day O
something O
horrible O
and O
inevitable O
happen B-INCORRECT
. O

It O
was O
a O
dark O
night O
it B-INCORRECT
raining O
until B-INCORRECT
big O
active B-INCORRECT
volcano B-INCORRECT
explosion B-INCORRECT
buried O
them O
into B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
underground O
. O

All O
of O
them O
tried O
to O
find O
a O
way O
out O
! B-INCORRECT
, O
but O
no O
one O
ca B-INCORRECT
n't B-INCORRECT
... O
They O
started O
get O
panicked B-INCORRECT

People O
just O
started O
to O
evacuated B-INCORRECT
rapidly O
until O
it O
began B-INCORRECT
a O
big O
earthquake O
... O

Penny O
was O
too B-INCORRECT
sad O
, B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
only O
thing O
that O
he O
can B-INCORRECT
do O
is B-INCORRECT
to O
wait O
and O
keep O
calm O
. O

Until B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
dawn O
all O
of O
them O
go B-INCORRECT
out O
, O
so O
they O
sacred O
until O
find B-INCORRECT
a O
refuge O
. O

Everyone O
wanted O
to O
witness B-INCORRECT
the O
queen O
, O
but O
no O
one O
find B-INCORRECT
something B-INCORRECT
. O

Like B-INCORRECT
they B-INCORRECT
were O
very O
religious O
ants O
prey B-INCORRECT
for B-INCORRECT
her B-INCORRECT
sacred O
ancestors O
so O
can B-INCORRECT
help O
them O
in B-INCORRECT
the O
big B-INCORRECT
deal B-INCORRECT
. O

Something O
that O
they O
don B-INCORRECT
know O
was O
the O
whole O
thing O
a O
movie O
! O

So O
all O
was O
planned O
... O

The O
actors O
had O
monitors O
that O
watch B-INCORRECT
the O
ants O
all O
time O
. O

One O
day O
Penny B-INCORRECT
discovered O
it B-INCORRECT
and O
go B-INCORRECT
to O
tell O
his O
queen O
, B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
at B-INCORRECT
knowing B-INCORRECT
that O
she B-INCORRECT
get B-INCORRECT
very O
confused O
but O
same O
time O
mad O
wanted O
revenge O
. O

So O
they O
make B-INCORRECT
a O
plan O
to O
display O
all O
... O

The O
next O
day O
when B-INCORRECT
they B-INCORRECT
were O
about O
to O
start O
filming O
ere B-INCORRECT
non B-INCORRECT
ants O
there O
so B-INCORRECT
search B-INCORRECT
for O
them O
, O
but O
ca B-INCORRECT
n't O
find O
... O

In B-INCORRECT
that O
moment O
the B-INCORRECT
ants O
and O
Penny O
attack B-INCORRECT
them O
in B-INCORRECT
their B-INCORRECT
backs B-INCORRECT
, O
making O
to B-INCORRECT
leave O
place O
. O

The O
ants O
win B-INCORRECT
the O
war O
and O
they O
expand B-INCORRECT
their O
habitat O
to O
studio O
. O

No O
one O
attack B-INCORRECT
them O
again O
and O
they O
live B-INCORRECT
happily O
ever O
after O
! O

I O
have O
many O
favorite O
sports O
. O

One B-INCORRECT
of B-INCORRECT
them B-INCORRECT
I O
'm O
keen O
on O
playing O
basketball O
the O
best B-INCORRECT
. O
always O
spend O
more O
time O
it O

I O
usually O
play O
basketball O
everyday B-INCORRECT
around O
at O
least O
thirty O
minutes O
per O
day O
. O

After O
a O
hard O
day O
at O
University B-INCORRECT
I O
go O
home O
and O
then O
to O
the O
stadium O
play O
it O
. O

One B-INCORRECT
thing B-INCORRECT
makes B-INCORRECT
sure O
that O
I O
already B-INCORRECT
finished O
all O
of O
my O
work O
before O
play O
favorite O
sport O
. O

Basketball O
has O
many O
benefits O
not B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
me O
but O
also O
everyone B-INCORRECT
. O

It O
makes O
me O
feel O
relaxed O
and O
unwind O
. O

Besides O
, O
it O
also O
helps O
me O
keep O
fit O
and O
have O
a O
good O
body O
shape O
. O

I O
really B-INCORRECT
cra O

zy O
about O
playing O
it O
. O

When O
I O
have O
spare O
time O
, O
often O
gather O
my B-INCORRECT
friends O
to O
watch O
basketball O
match B-INCORRECT
on O
television O
. O

I O
often O
play O
basketball O
at O
the O
stadium O
in O
morning O
. O

Sometimes O
, O
I O
play O
it O
near O
sports B-INCORRECT
centre O
. O

I O
go O
back O
home O
and O
have O
a O
sleep B-INCORRECT
deeply B-INCORRECT
when O
finished B-INCORRECT
it B-INCORRECT
. O

basketball O
is O
an O
outdoor O
activity O
. O

That O
's O
reason B-INCORRECT
why O
basketball O
is O
my O
favorite O
sport O
. O

With O
the O
sweeping O
progress O
of O
development O
and O
booming O
population B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
many B-INCORRECT
agricultueal B-INCORRECT
land O
forest O
ocesn B-INCORRECT
had B-INCORRECT
been O
used O
to B-INCORRECT
destroyed O
build O
more O
constructure B-INCORRECT
transport O
networks O
. O

From O
my O
own O
perspective O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
it O
will O
bring O
many O
drawbacks O
to O
the O
environment O
or O
even O
human B-INCORRECT
and O
animals O
. O

To O
start O
with O
, O
there O
are O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
troublesome B-INCORRECT
it O
maybe B-INCORRECT
leadding B-INCORRECT
to O
this B-INCORRECT
phenomeon B-INCORRECT
. O

Convincing O
arguments O
can B-INCORRECT
support O
that B-INCORRECT
the O
root O
cause O
is O
almost O
all O
persent B-INCORRECT
day O
cities O
are O
already O
packed O
with O
places O
of O
residence O
, O
commerce B-INCORRECT
and B-INCORRECT
recreation O
land O
available O
for O
new O
housing O
developments O
increasingly O
scarce O
. O

Additionally O
, O
people O
now O
continues B-INCORRECT
destroyed B-INCORRECT
more O
agricultures B-INCORRECT
and O
forest O
in O
order O
to O
satisfy O
all O
their O
need B-INCORRECT
which O
will O
distory B-INCORRECT
the O
ecosystem O
diversity B-INCORRECT
biodiversity O
especially B-INCORRECT
endangered O
species O
. O

According B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
the O
problems O
above B-INCORRECT
mentioned B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
various O
approaches O
that O
governmentshould B-INCORRECT
be B-INCORRECT
adopted B-INCORRECT
deal O
with O
this O
problem.first B-INCORRECT
of O
all O
reducing O
building O
constructure B-INCORRECT
from O
now O
on O
planting B-INCORRECT
more O
trees O
instead O
. O

Sustainadle B-INCORRECT
development O
should O
be O
awaness O
to O
all O
human O
and B-INCORRECT
start O
porteat B-INCORRECT
the O
environment O
preserve O
animals O
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
this O
unpleasant O
phenmenon B-INCORRECT
and O
problems B-INCORRECT
should O
be O
worked O
out B-INCORRECT
to O
resolve O
before B-INCORRECT
thing B-INCORRECT
get O
worse O
ang B-INCORRECT
the O
governments O
have O
take O
responsibility O
for O
that O
. O

Nowadays O
the B-INCORRECT
languages O
are O
very O
important O
, O
and B-INCORRECT
more B-INCORRECT
English B-INCORRECT
. O

This O
is O
not O
my B-INCORRECT
first O
time O
that O
I O
study B-INCORRECT
English O
. O

I O
have O
been O
studying O
English O
since B-INCORRECT
was O
child B-INCORRECT
and O
never O
speak B-INCORRECT
learn B-INCORRECT
so O
well O
decided O
to O
go O
London O
one O
course O
this O
language O
. O

I B-INCORRECT
have B-INCORRECT
taken B-INCORRECT
that O
decision O
because O
was O
tired O
to B-INCORRECT
try B-INCORRECT
learn O
English O
and O
did O
not O
the O
level O
want B-INCORRECT
, O
so O
when O
heard O
about O
ooportunity B-INCORRECT
said O
yes O
. O

The O
car O
is O
n't O
the B-INCORRECT
best O
way O
for B-INCORRECT
transport O
, O
because O
it O
produce B-INCORRECT
much B-INCORRECT
pollution O
however B-INCORRECT
public O
better O
to B-INCORRECT
do B-INCORRECT
a O
journey O
. O

It O
can O
carry O
many O
people O
without O
problems O
. O

Nowadays O
in O
the B-INCORRECT
cities B-INCORRECT
developed B-INCORRECT
there O
are O
many O
possibilities O
for B-INCORRECT
public O
transport O
, B-INCORRECT
like O
bus O
train O
subway O
tram O
etc.these B-INCORRECT
options O
it B-INCORRECT
's B-INCORRECT
more O
economical O
than O
car O
problem O
of B-INCORRECT
is O
that O
normally B-INCORRECT
occupied O
a B-INCORRECT
person O
when O
prepared B-INCORRECT
to O
carry O
four O
or O
five O
people O
. O

this B-INCORRECT
situation O
to B-INCORRECT
create B-INCORRECT
many B-INCORRECT
pollution O
for B-INCORRECT
environment B-INCORRECT
so B-INCORRECT
we O
have O
more B-INCORRECT
conscience B-INCORRECT
the O
planet O
health B-INCORRECT

I O

for O
next B-INCORRECT
reasons O
: O

First O
reason O
; B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
grammar O
that O
learners B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
teachers O
or O
institutes O
teach O
is O
like O

very O
difficult O

Languaje B-INCORRECT
just B-INCORRECT
Imaging B-INCORRECT
you B-INCORRECT
same O
but O
not O

lenguaje B-INCORRECT
. O

Second O
reason O
. B-INCORRECT
in O
the B-INCORRECT
English O
syntaxis B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
structure B-INCORRECT
for O
construction B-INCORRECT
paragraph B-INCORRECT
or O
sentences O

but O
no B-INCORRECT
always O
Which B-INCORRECT
rule O
? O

Is O
there O
anyone B-INCORRECT
? O

The O
third O
reason O
: O

I O
love O
to O
play O
cricket O
. O

I O
am O
enthusiastic O
towards B-INCORRECT
this O
game O
. O

My O
favourite O
team O
is O

because O
I O
belongs B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
this O
country O
. O

In O
India O
, O
85 O
percent O
people B-INCORRECT
follow O
cricket O
. O

In O
1993 O
, O
Indian B-INCORRECT
cricket O
team O
won O
his B-INCORRECT
first O
world O
cup O
and O
that O

Ramesh O
Tendulakar O
know B-INCORRECT
as O

. O

Whenever O

, O
Style B-INCORRECT
shots O

. O

Not O

every O
Indian O

When O
he O

. O

He O
is B-INCORRECT
the O

they B-INCORRECT
have O
to O
decide O
what B-INCORRECT
con B-INCORRECT
do O
better O
, O
batting O
or O
bowling O
. O

If O
the B-INCORRECT
person B-INCORRECT
want O
to O
become O

then B-INCORRECT
concentrate O
on O
running O
, B-INCORRECT
action O
stance O
and O
for B-INCORRECT
batsmen O
need O
concentration O
lag B-INCORRECT
bat O
coordination O
eye O
discover B-INCORRECT
some O
shots O
which O
became B-INCORRECT
key O
factor B-INCORRECT
in O
batting O
. O

Also O
watch B-INCORRECT
videos O
of O
some O
best B-INCORRECT

like B-INCORRECT
Sachin O
, O
Rahul O
Sir O
Don O
breadman O
Hayden O

sport O
so B-INCORRECT
also B-INCORRECT
need O
to O

Dear O

a B-INCORRECT
impressed B-INCORRECT
time O
. O

The O
weather O
is O
neither O
hot O
nor O
cold O
all O
year O
, B-INCORRECT
you B-INCORRECT
need O
n't O
bring O
too O
many O
clothes O
because O
can O
buy O
in B-INCORRECT
here O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
travel O
this B-INCORRECT
city O
. B-INCORRECT
I O
can O
be O
your O
guide O
as O
have O
a O
year O
free O
before O
university O
too O

This O
is O
a O
modern O
city O
. O

People O
usually O
went B-INCORRECT
here O
for O
shopping O
or O
eating O
. O

There O
are O
many O
local B-INCORRECT
foods B-INCORRECT
very B-INCORRECT
popular B-INCORRECT
. O

You O
may O
like O
this O
. O

I O
also O
want O
to O
introduce O
my O
friends O
you O
, B-INCORRECT
we B-INCORRECT
can O
have O
fun O
together O
. O

when B-INCORRECT
you O
have O
played O
enough O
in O
this O
city O
, O
and O
want O
to O
find O
a O
job O
here O
. B-INCORRECT

I O
can O
recommed B-INCORRECT
you O
to O
my O
uncle O
's O
company O
do B-INCORRECT
a O
job O
. O

Because O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
get O
a O
job O
here O
if O
you O
are O
foreign O
and O
haven't O
finished O
college O
. O

It O
may O
take O
very B-INCORRECT
long O
time O
to O
find O
a O
job O
and O
you O
have O
not O
much O
here O
. O

You O
may B-INCORRECT
consider O
my O
advice O
. O

My O
favorite O
sport O
is O
swims B-INCORRECT
. O

It O
's O
because O
swim B-INCORRECT
is O
really O
fun O
. O

Also O
I O
think O
swim B-INCORRECT
can O
keep O
our B-INCORRECT
body O
fit O
and O
it O
make O
the B-INCORRECT
people O
who O
feel O
cool O
when O
is O
in B-INCORRECT
a O
hot O
day O
. O

The O
advice O
that O
I O
give B-INCORRECT
to O
someone O
who O
want B-INCORRECT
start O
swimming O
. O

It O
is O
not O
be B-INCORRECT
afraid O
of O
water O
, O
otherwise O
they O
may B-INCORRECT
learn O
swim B-INCORRECT
and B-INCORRECT
also O
when B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
age B-INCORRECT
become O
older O
it O
will O
more O
difficult O
to O
than O
little B-INCORRECT
. O

So O
these B-INCORRECT
are B-INCORRECT
the O
advice O
that O
I O
give O
to O
them O
. O

Dear O

Neither B-INCORRECT
I B-INCORRECT

According B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
my O
age O
, O
evening O
activities O
are O
not O
a O
problem O
for O
me O
and O
I O
played B-INCORRECT
many O
sports O
during O
life O
such O
as O

The O
city O
where O
I O
live O
is O
a O
small O
village O
. O

All O
residents O
take O
great O
care O
of O
the O
environment O
. O

Organized O
shares O
, O
where O
everyone O
clean B-INCORRECT
up O
the O
village O
. O

All O
residents O
segregate O
garbage O
thrown O
into O
suitable O
containers O
. O

Thus O
helping O
to O
protect O
our O
environment O
make O
it O
clean O
, O
safe O
in B-INCORRECT
order O
not O
jeopardize O
various O
diseases O
. O

In O
my O
village O
there O
are O
trash O
cans O
, O
so O
that O
no O
one O
threw B-INCORRECT
debris B-INCORRECT
on O
the O
ground O
. O

There O
are O
spcejalne O
place B-INCORRECT
where O
you O
can O
organize O
bonfires O
, O
but O
everyone O
has O
to O
clean O
up O
after O
themselves O
and O
throw O
out O
all O
garbage O
. O

We O
have O
the O
ability O
to O
use O
renewable O
energy O
sources O
, O
because O
it O
is O
close O
a O
wind O
power O
plant O
. O

Recently O
, O
also O
on B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
roof O
of O
primary O
school O
were B-INCORRECT
set B-INCORRECT
batteries B-INCORRECT
and O
whole O
uses O
solar O
energy O
instead O
electricity O
. O

They O
organize O
monthly O
meetings O
on O
the O
environment O
, O
residents O
participate O
in O
them O
. O

Wszysycy O
residents B-INCORRECT
of O
my O
village O
, O
they O
try O
to O
so O
that B-INCORRECT
our O
was B-INCORRECT
clear B-INCORRECT
pollute B-INCORRECT
the O
environment O
as O
little O
possible O
. O

Travelling O
in B-INCORRECT
their B-INCORRECT
own O
car O
is O
way O
more O
comfortable O
than O
taking O
a O
ride O
public O
transportation.there B-INCORRECT
are O
several O
reason O
to O
consider O
. O

Firstly O
, O
the O
bus O
is O
always O
drop B-INCORRECT
by B-INCORRECT
to O
get B-INCORRECT
a B-INCORRECT
passenger O
that B-INCORRECT
take B-INCORRECT
more O
time B-INCORRECT
than O
expected O
of B-INCORRECT
travel O
. O

Secondly O
, O
the O
public O
vehicle O
route B-INCORRECT
are O
more O
far O
than O
usual O
. O

Thirdly O
, O
it O
is O
also O
crowded O
and O
no B-INCORRECT
privacy O
. O

Finally O
, O
there O
is O
a O
chance B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
become B-INCORRECT
victim O
of O
theft O
and O
pocket B-INCORRECT
picker B-INCORRECT
. O

However O
, O
public O
transportation O
is O
much O
cheaper O
than O
to B-INCORRECT
buy B-INCORRECT
a O
new O
car O
and O
for B-INCORRECT
the O
adventurer O
who O
want B-INCORRECT
have O
an O
exciting O
travel B-INCORRECT
then O
see O
more O
action O
. O

Like O
watching B-INCORRECT
outside O
or O
sight B-INCORRECT
seeing B-INCORRECT
, O
to B-INCORRECT
mingle B-INCORRECT
and O
meet B-INCORRECT
different O
people O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
I B-INCORRECT
also O
admire O
the O
bullet O
train O
in O
japan B-INCORRECT
which O
u B-INCORRECT
consider O
fast B-INCORRECT
and O
safe B-INCORRECT
public O
vehicle O
Ive'd B-INCORRECT
known B-INCORRECT
. O

To O
sum O
it B-INCORRECT
up O
I B-INCORRECT
still O
consider O
having O
their B-INCORRECT
own O
car O
is B-INCORRECT
way O
more O
safe O
and O
convinient B-INCORRECT
. O

Public O
future O
unless O
they O
have O
project B-INCORRECT
to O
at O
least O
lessen O
the O
time B-INCORRECT
of B-INCORRECT
travel B-INCORRECT
and O
prioritize O
safety O
their O
passenger B-INCORRECT
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
'm O
concerned O
, O
tend O
to O
disagree O
with O
the B-INCORRECT
decision B-INCORRECT
of B-INCORRECT
mineral O
extraction O
. O

More O
details O
and O
reasons O
will O
be O
elaborated O
in O
the O
following O
paragraphs O
to O
support O
my O
opinion O
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, O
extract B-INCORRECT
the O
mineral O
will O
be O
harmful O
to O
our O
environment O
. O

There O
are O
breathtaking O
sights O
on O
the O
outskirts O
of O
my O
hometown O
. O

In O
my O
childhood O
, O
I O
went O
there O
to O
spend O
summer O
every O
year O
. O

However O
, O
it O
will O
probably O
be B-INCORRECT
disappeared B-INCORRECT
if O
the O
developing O
equipment O
were O
being O
set O
. O

Next O
to B-INCORRECT
go B-INCORRECT
will B-INCORRECT
be B-INCORRECT
, O
the O
extraction O
of O
valuable O
mineral O
definitely O
leads B-INCORRECT
air O
pollution O
. O

There O
has O
been O
an O
example O
that O
the O
other O
town O
is O
polluted O
by O
process O
of O
developing O
mineral O
. O

No O
one O
can O
deny O
that O
the O
pollution O
issue B-INCORRECT
is O
of O
utmost B-INCORRECT
important O
thing B-INCORRECT
which O
should O
be O
prevented O
. O

Last O
but O
not O
the B-INCORRECT
least O
, O
mineral O
extraction O
will O
turn O
out O
to B-INCORRECT
be B-INCORRECT
profound O
influence B-INCORRECT
especially O
our O
offspring O
. O

To O
take O
my O
friend O
, O
Taylor O
as O
an O
example O
her O
homeland O
were B-INCORRECT
over O
- O
developed O
and O
become B-INCORRECT
arid O
place O
when O
she O
was O
a O
child O
. O

After O
she O
grows B-INCORRECT
up O
, O
decides B-INCORRECT
to O
leave O
and O
never O
go O
back O
her O
hometown O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
she O
has O
no O
blithe B-INCORRECT
memory B-INCORRECT
in B-INCORRECT
her O
childhood O
. O

One O
problem O
is O
that O
some O
people O
will O
consider O
the O
job O
opportunity B-INCORRECT
it O
might O
bring O
to B-INCORRECT
us O
. O

Due O
to O
the B-INCORRECT
mineral O
development B-INCORRECT
, O
many O
people O
in O
our O
hometown O
can B-INCORRECT
probably O
earn O
much O
more O
money O
than O
before O
. O

It O
seems O
like O
a O
sought O
- O
after O
chance O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
they O
do O
not O
give O
us O
any O
promise O
of O
the B-INCORRECT
vacancy B-INCORRECT
. O

In O
addition O
, O
money O
is O
no B-INCORRECT
more O
crucial O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
health O
and O
environmental O
conservation O
. O

In O
a O
nutshell O
, O
Based B-INCORRECT
on O
the B-INCORRECT
reasons O
and O
instances B-INCORRECT
above O
disadvantages O
of O
extract B-INCORRECT
valuable O
mineral B-INCORRECT
are B-INCORRECT
outweigh O
advantage B-INCORRECT
. O

Therefore O
, O
I O
do O
not O
subscribe O
to O
this O
decision O
. O

Limiting O
cars O
on O
the O
roads O
would O
cause O
disappearing B-INCORRECT
of O
poo O
. O

The O
fossil O
fuels O
used O
by O
vehicles O
cause O
global O
warming O
. O

Global O
warming O
is O
a O
serious O
issue O
, B-INCORRECT
higher O
temperatures O
make O
the O
ice O
caps O
melt O
. O

The O
longer O
we O
burry B-INCORRECT
our O
heads O
in O
sand B-INCORRECT
, O
the O
warmer O
Earth O
will O
be O
. O

I O
learn B-INCORRECT
English O
to O
improve O
the O
general O
quality O
of O
my O
sentences O
! O

I O
do O
n't O
believe B-INCORRECT
in B-INCORRECT
it O
, O
especially O
while O
cars O
are O
not O
flying O
. O

Even O
if O
it O
will B-INCORRECT
have B-INCORRECT
happened B-INCORRECT
there O
are O
many O
people O
who O
ca O
n't O
get O
a O
car O
, O
because O
is O
too O
exspensive B-INCORRECT
not O
only O
for B-INCORRECT
buying B-INCORRECT
but O
fuel O
service O
and O
so O
forth O
. O

Buses O
are O
more B-INCORRECT
simple B-INCORRECT
- O
you O
just O
buy O
a O
ticket O

And O
what O
about O
trains O
? O

I O
saw O
tv B-INCORRECT
about O
train B-INCORRECT
in O
Japan O
- O
that O
is O
the O
future O
of O
public O
transport O
. O

I O
want O
to O
see O

care O
by B-INCORRECT
me O
all O
the O
time O
when O
parents B-INCORRECT
busy O
with O
their O
works B-INCORRECT
. O

During B-INCORRECT
my B-INCORRECT
school O
, O
I O
like O
to O
play O
volleyball O
and O
i B-INCORRECT
'm O
an O
excellent O
player O
. O

We O
used B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
organise O
competitions O
and O
tournaments O
with O
others B-INCORRECT
school O
. O

This O
is O
my O
favourite O

. O

During O
my O
leisure O
time O
, O
I O
like O
to O
help O

in O
the O
kitchen O

We O
cook O
varieties B-INCORRECT
of O
food O
and O

. O

I O
enjoy O
the O

With O

the B-INCORRECT

I O

Contemporary O
Art O
is O
a O
very O
controversial O
issue B-INCORRECT
nowadays O
. O

There O
are O
many O
sources O
and O
creators O
, O
as O
well O
themes O
. O

It O
is O
well O
known O
that O
many O
Art B-INCORRECT
curators O
and O
Artists B-INCORRECT
believes B-INCORRECT
Contemporary B-INCORRECT
not O
a O
good O
source O
of O
art O
, O
since O
there O
are O
artists O
only O
create O
based O
in B-INCORRECT
their O
easy O
ideas O
an O
aesthetic O
image O
or O
philosophical O
idea O
but O
most O
the O
times B-INCORRECT
this O
unintelligible O
. O

Luckily O
the B-INCORRECT
most O
expensive O
art O
still B-INCORRECT
being B-INCORRECT
old O
, B-INCORRECT
like O
Picasso O
or O
Freud O
. O

Nowadays O
a B-INCORRECT
lot O
of O
empty O
art B-INCORRECT
pieces B-INCORRECT
are O
being O
sold O
at O
auctions O
around O
the O
world O
, B-INCORRECT
for O
extraordinary B-INCORRECT
high O
prices O
. O

Experimental O
Art O
has O
taken O
the O
world O
of O
art O
by O
surprise O
. O

Humanity O
has O
reached O
a O
level O
of O
differences O
that O
it O
would B-INCORRECT
be B-INCORRECT
not B-INCORRECT
possible O
to O
stop O
. O

So O
now O
we O
have O
many O
choices O
and O
an O
infinity O
of O
information O
available O
at O
any O
given O
time O
. O

With O
this O
stated O
, O
we O
now O
have O
an O
idea O
of O
how O
artists O
create O
. O

The O
sports O
days O
were O
held O
on O
Kwai O
Chung O
Sports O
Ground O
in B-INCORRECT
12th O
and O
13 B-INCORRECT
th B-INCORRECT
November O
. O

That B-INCORRECT
weather O
was O
partly O
cloudy O
. O

I O
got O
there O
by O
MTR O
. O

I O
arrived O
the B-INCORRECT
sports O
ground O
at O
7:40 O
a.m. O
This O
year O
've B-INCORRECT
join B-INCORRECT
100-metre O
race O
. O

On O
the O
first O
day O
before O
sports O
begin B-INCORRECT
, O
we O
have B-INCORRECT
opening O
ceremony O
. O

The O
athletic O
representative O
pasted O
the O
torch O
and O
we O
sang O
anthem O
. O

After O
that O
, O
the O
sports O
day O
began O
formally B-INCORRECT
. O

At O
10:45 O
a.m. O
, O
the O
girl O
's O
grade O
C O
100-metre O
race O
started O
. O

There O
was O
a O
funny O
thing O
when O
I O
went O
to O
the O
marshal O
. O

The O
teacher O
call B-INCORRECT
my O
name O
for B-INCORRECT
twice O
and O
he O
told O
me O
to O
stand O
different B-INCORRECT
place O
. O

So O
I O
know B-INCORRECT
that O
there O
was O
someone O
whose O
name O
pronounce B-INCORRECT
same B-INCORRECT
as O
me B-INCORRECT
. O

Near B-INCORRECT
the O
race O
, O
I O
was O
very O
nervous O
. O

When O
I O
was O
running O
, O
heard O
my O
housemates O
cheering O
and O
the B-INCORRECT
wind O
passing O
face O
. O

That O
feel B-INCORRECT
was O
very O
comfortable B-INCORRECT
and O
made O
me O
felt B-INCORRECT
relax B-INCORRECT
. O

At O
last O
, O
I O
got B-INCORRECT
number B-INCORRECT
10 B-INCORRECT
out O
of O
27 O
people O
. O

Although O
it O
is O
not O
a O
great O
result O
, O
I O
've B-INCORRECT
already B-INCORRECT
try B-INCORRECT
my O
best O
. O

At O
last B-INCORRECT
of O
the O
day O
, O
our O
school O
announced O
mark O
four O
houses O
have B-INCORRECT
got O
. O

My O
house O
which B-INCORRECT
got B-INCORRECT
number O
two O
temporarily O
. O

I O
felt O
hopeful O
and O
wanted O
my O
house O
will B-INCORRECT
get B-INCORRECT
the O
champion B-INCORRECT
. O

On O
the B-INCORRECT
second O
day O
, O
my O
classmates O
called O
me O
to O
take O
part O
Inter B-INCORRECT
- O
class O
relay O
race O
. O

I O
felt O
very B-INCORRECT
afraid O
because O
was O
not O
good O
at O
running O
. O

Finally O
, O
our O
class O
got B-INCORRECT
the O
first O
runner O
up B-INCORRECT
. O

We O
have B-INCORRECT
a O
difference O
of O
0.5 O
seconds O
is B-INCORRECT
the O
first B-INCORRECT
race O
. O

I O
implicated B-INCORRECT
my O
class O
from O
winning O
the O
champion B-INCORRECT
. O

At B-INCORRECT
last B-INCORRECT
, O
my O
house O
got B-INCORRECT
the O
second B-INCORRECT
runner O
up B-INCORRECT
. O

I O
hope O
my O
house O
will O
get B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
champion B-INCORRECT
in B-INCORRECT
next O
year O
. O

" O
There O
is O
no O
future O
for O
public O
transport O
, O
because O
travelling O
by O
car O
so O
much O
more O
convenient O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
this O
affirmation O
is O
not O
correct O
. O

We O
should O
used B-INCORRECT
of B-INCORRECT
public O
transport O
because O
at O
the O
present O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
cars O
in O
world O
that O
pollute O
and O
unfortunately B-INCORRECT
we B-INCORRECT
harming O
environment O
. O

It O
is O
the B-INCORRECT
best O
that O
all O
people O
go O
to O
place O
walking B-INCORRECT
o B-INCORRECT
running O
on B-INCORRECT
other B-INCORRECT
hand B-INCORRECT
it O
more O
healthy O
. O

There O
is O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
it B-INCORRECT
go B-INCORRECT
to O
the B-INCORRECT
place O
in O
a O
car O
, O
obviously O
faster O
than O
bus O
and O
cheaper O
but B-INCORRECT
no B-INCORRECT
always O
. O

I O
think O
it O
is O
true O
that O
travelling O
by O
car O
so O
much O
more O
convenient O
but B-INCORRECT
disagree O
there O
no O
future O
for O
public O
transport O
. O

Is B-INCORRECT
is O
commonly O
- B-INCORRECT
debated O
that O
tourism O
has O
greatly O
influenced O
, B-INCORRECT
not O
only O
the O
aspects O
of O
one B-INCORRECT
country O
but O
whole O

along B-INCORRECT

Whethere B-INCORRECT
tourism O
has O
had O
a O
positive O
or O
negative O
impact O
over B-INCORRECT
our O
lifes B-INCORRECT
, O
it O
remains O
quite O
dilemma O
for O
the O
ignorants O

First O
of O
all O
, O
tourism O
is O
a O

Alongside O
with B-INCORRECT
its O
development O

the O
ablity B-INCORRECT

whole O
next B-INCORRECT
year O
. O

Maybe O
I O
found O
something O
for O
you O
: O
when O
were B-INCORRECT
on O
the O
bus O
returning O
to B-INCORRECT
home O
read O
a O
journal B-INCORRECT
with O
some O
advertisements O
. O

There O
is O
a O
nice O
flat O
near O
my O
home O
: O
it O
perfect O
to B-INCORRECT
someone O
who O
want B-INCORRECT
live O
there O
for O
only O
an B-INCORRECT
year O

great O
bedroom O
bathroom O
with O

but O
without O

. O

I O

Hello O
Riley O
, B-INCORRECT
about O
the O
question O
you O
made B-INCORRECT
me O
in O
your O
letter O
it B-INCORRECT
has O
been O
hard O
to O
give O
an O
answer O
because O
I O
know O
how O
much O
love O
both O
. O

Last O
night O
I O
made O
a O
decision O
. O

I O
think O
that O
you O
should O
give O
up O
from B-INCORRECT
your O
music O
classes O
. O

You O
have O
classes B-INCORRECT
since O
you O
were O
nine O
years O
old O
and O
already O
know O
how O
to O
play O
piano O
, O
so O
I O
think O
that O
should O
continue O
doing O
sports O
because B-INCORRECT
it O
is O
important O
for O
your O
health O
in O
free O
times O
could O
still O
without O
going O
the B-INCORRECT
. O

This O
is O
my O
opinion O
but B-INCORRECT
the O
decision O
yours O
, O
so O
when O
you O
decide O
it B-INCORRECT
please O
send O
me O
a O
letter O
telling O
about O
. O

Love O
, O
Ines O
. O

Hey O
my B-INCORRECT
name O
is O
Joe O
and O
i B-INCORRECT
'm O
21 O
years O
old O
i'l B-INCORRECT
think O
would O
compliment B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
summer O
camp O
very B-INCORRECT
good B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
because O
of O
manner B-INCORRECT
open O
for B-INCORRECT
kids O
so B-INCORRECT
they O
can O
up O
speak O
. O

My O
current O
job O
is O
to B-INCORRECT
be B-INCORRECT
a O
nurse O
at O
the O
local O
hospital O
and O
i'l B-INCORRECT
can O
do O
everything O
as B-INCORRECT
doctor O
. O

So O
if B-INCORRECT
the O
kids O
is B-INCORRECT
going B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
hurt O
themselves O
, O
then O
i'l B-INCORRECT
can O
fix O
them O
up O
instead O
of O
taking O
hospital O
for O
small O
things O
like O
bruises O
and O
smaller O
injuries O
. O

The O
most O
exciting O
day O
of O
my O
life O
was O
the O
3rd O
June O
, B-INCORRECT
last O
year O
. O

I O
had O
an O
exam O
. O

That O
day O
I O
woke O
up O
early O
because O
was O
nervous O
. O

Then O
I O
revise B-INCORRECT
Maths O
as B-INCORRECT
at B-INCORRECT
home O
, B-INCORRECT
before O
to B-INCORRECT
go B-INCORRECT
school O
begin B-INCORRECT
the O
exam O
. O

When O
I O
started O
to O
read O
the O
tracks O
fell O
agitated O
and O
thought O
that O
was B-INCORRECT
n't B-INCORRECT
able O
finish O
pass O
test O
. O

But O
when O
I B-INCORRECT
finished O
before O
the O
time O
was O
happy O
and O
relaxed O
. O

I O
always O
said O
that O
passed B-INCORRECT
test O
and O
was O
sure O
of O
. O

And O
this B-INCORRECT
is O
true O
. O

I O
passed O
that O
test O
! O

n't O

of O
competitions O

kind O
If B-INCORRECT
'd B-INCORRECT
have B-INCORRECT
posibility B-INCORRECT
going O
already O
spend B-INCORRECT
the O
tickets O
. O

My O
favourite O
sport O

When O
I O
was O
three O
years O
old O
, O
my O
parents O
went O
skiing O
with O
me O
. O

At O
the O
beginn B-INCORRECT
I O
went O
to O
childgarden B-INCORRECT
and O
they O
taught O
me O
skiing B-INCORRECT
. O

It O
was O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
, O
because O
I O
could O
not O
it B-INCORRECT
. O

At O
twelve O
o'clock O
in O
the O
daytime B-INCORRECT
my O
parents O
took O
me O
with O
them O
and O
we O
drove B-INCORRECT
together O
. O

My O
father O
took O
me O
between O
his O
knies B-INCORRECT
, O
because O
I O
could O
drive B-INCORRECT
without O
falling O
and B-INCORRECT
it O
was O
fun O
. O

When O
I O
was O
older O
, O
could B-INCORRECT
get O
better O
my B-INCORRECT
dream O
was:"SNOWBOARDING O
" O
but O
should B-INCORRECT
learn O
skiiing B-INCORRECT
perfectly O
like O
parents O
. O

Later O
when B-INCORRECT
I O
was O
16 O
years O
old O
, O
my O
dream O
get B-INCORRECT
true O
. O

I O
had O
my O
first O
snowboardlesson B-INCORRECT
und B-INCORRECT
loved O
it O
. O

I O
took O
every O
free O
minute O
to O
drive B-INCORRECT
snowboard B-INCORRECT
. O

That O
was B-INCORRECT
the O
story O
why B-INCORRECT
I O
go O
snowboarding O
. O

I O
enjoy O
snowoarding B-INCORRECT
, O
because O
you O
feel O
free O
when O
are O
driving B-INCORRECT
down O
the O
piste O
. O

You O
are O
like O
a O
bird O
. O

It O
is O
the O
best O
feeling O
in O
world O
. O

You O
are O
very O
happy O
und B-INCORRECT
sometimes O
I O
sing O
a O
song O
and O
the O
world O
is O
perfect O
. O

That O
is O
everything O
I O
want O
to O
have O
and O
i B-INCORRECT
'm O
lucky O
. O

That O
's O
why O
I O
like O
the O
winter O
more O
than O
summer O
. O

Snowboarding O
or O
skiing O
is O
the O
best O
sport O
for O
everyone B-INCORRECT
who O
want B-INCORRECT
to O
come O
other O
thoughts O
. O

Although B-INCORRECT
you O
are B-INCORRECT
all O
the O
time O
in O
nature B-INCORRECT
and O
when B-INCORRECT
have B-INCORRECT
luck B-INCORRECT
can O
see O
animals O
. O

It O
had O
been O
a O
very O
long O
and O
tiring O
day O
, O
but O
Tom O
felt O
he O
achieved O
something O
really O
good O
. O

Yesterday O
, O
he O
was O
on O
his O
way O
to B-INCORRECT
home O
and O
it O
getting O
dark O
. O

his B-INCORRECT
parents O
were O
worried O
and O
called O
he B-INCORRECT
a O
couple O
of O
times O
. O

He O
started O
walking O
very O
quickly O

Everything O
was O
dark O
. O

She O
open B-INCORRECT
her O
eyes O
and O
the O
first O
thing O
that O
she O
saw O
was O
black O
sky O
. O

A O
dark O
sky O
without O
stars O
. O

She O
got O
up O
and O
look B-INCORRECT
around O
. O

She O
was O
in O
a O
part O
of O
the O
woods O
where O
she O
used O
to O
go O
think O
and O
relax O
. O

She O
started O
to O
take O
consciousness O
although B-INCORRECT
she O
could O
n't O
remember O
how O
arrived B-INCORRECT
there O
. O

She O
had O
to O
walk O
at O
least O
15 O
minutes O
go B-INCORRECT
from O
her O
house O
this O
place O
. O

The O
problem O
is B-INCORRECT
the O
last O
thing O
she O
remember B-INCORRECT
that O
has O
been O
sleeping O
and O
then O
suddenly O
woke O
up O
when O
window O
opened O
with B-INCORRECT
wind O
. O

She O
fell O
sleep O
again O
, O
didn't B-INCORRECT
she O
? O

If O
she B-INCORRECT
did O
, O
how O
managed B-INCORRECT
to O
walk O
until B-INCORRECT
there O
in O
her O
sleep O
? O

If O
she B-INCORRECT
was O
n't B-INCORRECT
awake O
, O
why O
could B-INCORRECT
remember O
anything O
after O
that O
? O

This O
situation O
it B-INCORRECT
was O
really O
fustrating B-INCORRECT
not O
to O
mention O
that O
now O
she O
had O
walk O
for O
almost O
20 O
minutes O
get O
home O
and O
back O
sleep O
. O

She O
started O
to O
walk O
clear O
her O
mind O
. O

She O
knows B-INCORRECT
her O
way O
even O
in O
the O
dark O
; O
she O
had O
gone O
to O
this O
spot O
a O
lot O
of O
time B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
specially B-INCORRECT
last O
few O
weeks O
. O

The O
development O
of O
human O
kind O
in O
technology O
is O
seen O
everywhere O
. O

In O
case B-INCORRECT
of O
transportation O
technology O
, O
in O
this O
twenty O
first O
century O
we B-INCORRECT
have O
various O
option B-INCORRECT
like O
Plan B-INCORRECT
that B-INCORRECT
can O
fly O
with B-INCORRECT
the O
cloud B-INCORRECT
train B-INCORRECT
fast B-INCORRECT
and O
big O
enough O
carry O
hundreds O
people O
travel O
mile B-INCORRECT
an O
hour O
boat B-INCORRECT
much B-INCORRECT
bigger O
faster O
than O
ancient B-INCORRECT
time B-INCORRECT
. O

Although O
compared O
to O
ancient O
time B-INCORRECT
we B-INCORRECT
are O
lucky O
enough O
that B-INCORRECT
have O
all O
these O
option O
. O

However O
, O
if O
I O
have B-INCORRECT
given O
option B-INCORRECT
to O
choose O
between O
all O
of B-INCORRECT
three O
will B-INCORRECT
say O
plane O
. O

There O
are O
three O
reason B-INCORRECT
to O
choose O
this O
. O

First B-INCORRECT
reason O
is O
its O
speed O
, B-INCORRECT
compare B-INCORRECT
to O
both O
other O
means O
of O
transportation O
it B-INCORRECT
can O
travel O
faster O
. O

It O
can O
travel O
thousand B-INCORRECT
of O
miles O
in O
a O
couple O
hours O
. O

As O
a O
result O
people B-INCORRECT
can O
save O
their B-INCORRECT
time O
. O

Second O
is B-INCORRECT
safety O
, O
compared O
to O
other O
the B-INCORRECT
chances O
of O
accident B-INCORRECT
less O
. O

That O
makes O
it O
safer O
to O
travel O
by O
plane O
rather O
than O
the B-INCORRECT
train O
or O
boat O
. O

Third B-INCORRECT
one O
is O
comfort O
level B-INCORRECT
. O

Plan B-INCORRECT
is O
much O
more O
comfortable O
than O
both O
train O
and O
boat O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
will O
say O
that O
plan B-INCORRECT
be O
my O
first O
choice O
in B-INCORRECT
all O
of B-INCORRECT
three O
means O
transportation O
. O

The O
reason O
behind O
my O
choice O
is O
speed O
, O
safety O
and O
comfort O
level B-INCORRECT
that B-INCORRECT
make O
plan B-INCORRECT
as B-INCORRECT
first O
. O

Everyone O
should O
take O
a O
year O
off O
between O
leaving O
school O
and O
starting O
college O
or O
university O
, B-INCORRECT
to O
earn O
money O
travel O
it B-INCORRECT
would O
be O
the B-INCORRECT
best O
award O
for O
student O
who O
attended B-INCORRECT
high O
. O

The B-INCORRECT
young B-INCORRECT
people O
want O
to B-INCORRECT
discover O
the O
world O
and O
travelling O
reach B-INCORRECT
places O
which O
would O
be O
unreachable O
otherwise O

I O
had O
a O
wonderful O
day O
yesterday O
because O
was O
in B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
beach O
all O
afternoon O
. O

I O
went O
with O
my O
parents O
and O
sister O
. O

The O
beach O
is O
located O
in O
A O
Guarda O
and O
its O
name O
O O
Muiño O
. O

There O
are B-INCORRECT
a O
lot O
of O
people O
in B-INCORRECT
the O
beach O
. O

The O
water O
was O
very O
cold O
and O
I O
could O
n't O
swim O
, O
then O
played O
football O
in O
the O
sand O
of B-INCORRECT
beach O
. O

I O

very O
long O
time O

then O
go B-INCORRECT
to O
cafe O
drank O

. O

It O
was O
a O
nice O
day O
because O
I O
spent B-INCORRECT
good O
time O
with O
my O
family O
. O

No O
future O
for O
a O
public O
transpotr B-INCORRECT
? O
is B-INCORRECT
this O
claim O
or B-INCORRECT
no B-INCORRECT

will B-INCORRECT
we O
see O
on B-INCORRECT
our B-INCORRECT
roads B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
public B-INCORRECT
transport B-INCORRECT
afer B-INCORRECT
5 O
or O
eve B-INCORRECT
10 O
years O
yet B-INCORRECT
? O
that B-INCORRECT
is O
really O
so B-INCORRECT
interesting O
question/ B-INCORRECT

i B-INCORRECT
think O
that O
it O
all O
depands B-INCORRECT
from B-INCORRECT
the O
development O
. O

now B-INCORRECT
we O
can O
see O
that O
more O
and O
people O
prefer O
travelling O
by O
car O
. O

yes B-INCORRECT
, O
i B-INCORRECT
agree O
if O
you B-INCORRECT
planed B-INCORRECT
the O
travelling B-INCORRECT
for O
a B-INCORRECT
long B-INCORRECT
distation B-INCORRECT
and O
time O
would O
prefer O
to O
do O
it O
on B-INCORRECT
car O
couse B-INCORRECT
firstly O
you;ll B-INCORRECT
spend O
less O
will O
be O
comfortable O
'll O
have O
possibility O
stop O
every B-INCORRECT
where O
as O
need O
. B-INCORRECT

but B-INCORRECT
if O
we O
are O
talking O
abot B-INCORRECT
travelling O
across O
you B-INCORRECT
city O
, O
would O
prefer O
public O
transport O
or O
car O
? O

i B-INCORRECT
think O
that O
this O
is O
the B-INCORRECT
guestion B-INCORRECT
for B-INCORRECT
every B-INCORRECT
one B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
and B-INCORRECT
answer B-INCORRECT
ca B-INCORRECT
n't B-INCORRECT
be B-INCORRECT
all O
cause B-INCORRECT
someone B-INCORRECT
can O
use O
public O
transport O
economy B-INCORRECT
by B-INCORRECT
not B-INCORRECT
only O
money O
but O
environment O
some O
people O
do O
like O
to O
p.t O
. O
they O
spend O
more O
time O
travelling O
or O
simple B-INCORRECT
travell B-INCORRECT
with O
another B-INCORRECT

so B-INCORRECT
, O
on B-INCORRECT
my O
opinion O
even O
after B-INCORRECT
10 O
years O
the B-INCORRECT
public O
transport O
will O
be O
crossing B-INCORRECT
our O
street B-INCORRECT
with O
enough B-INCORRECT
amount B-INCORRECT
of O
passangers B-INCORRECT

Michael O
wake B-INCORRECT
up O
at B-INCORRECT
the O
morning O
and O
he B-INCORRECT
read O
newspaper O
. O

He B-INCORRECT
read B-INCORRECT
in B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
newspaper B-INCORRECT
an O
interesting O
noticie B-INCORRECT
. O

The O
noticie B-INCORRECT
was O
about O
a O
competition O
. O

The O
competition O
is B-INCORRECT
about O
write B-INCORRECT
stories O
. O

Michael O
was O
excited O
because O
he O
is B-INCORRECT
great B-INCORRECT
writer O
and O
decided O
to O
compete B-INCORRECT
. O

First O
, O
he O
found O
an O
idea O
for O
the O
story O
and O
decided O
to O
make O
about O
pirates O
looking O
treasure O
. O

He O
began O
to O
write O
. O

The O
story O
was O
very O
good O
but O
Michae B-INCORRECT
did O
not O
know O
how O
to O
end O
the O
. O

Finally O
, O
Michael O
ended O
the O
story O
and O
he O
went O
to O
post O
office O
. O

Michael B-INCORRECT
sent O
the O
story O
but O
closed O
door O
and O
knew O
at O
that O
moment O
he B-INCORRECT
had O
made O
a O
mistake O
, B-INCORRECT
did O
n't O
put B-INCORRECT
his O
name O
address O
. O

Yes O
, O
i B-INCORRECT
think O
TV O
can O
entertain O
and O
educate O
because O
there O
are O
many O
comedy B-INCORRECT
. O

Also O
there O
are O
a O
lots B-INCORRECT
of O
educate B-INCORRECT
channels O
. O

I O
think O
historical O
channels O
are O
very O
interesting O
, O
because O
you O
can O
learn O
new O
thing B-INCORRECT
about O
past B-INCORRECT
. O

Comedies O
are O
so O
funny O
, O
when O
you O
sad O
u B-INCORRECT
can O
watch O
one O
of O
them O
. O

There O
are O
many O
discussions O
about O
the B-INCORRECT
future O
of O
public O
transport O
. O

Different O
experts O
had B-INCORRECT
talked O
about O
this O
question O
and O
there B-INCORRECT
are B-INCORRECT
so B-INCORRECT
several O
opinions O
. O

People O
like O
to O
have O
the O
freedom O
for B-INCORRECT
moving B-INCORRECT
comfortably O
and O
this O
reason O
, O
some O
people O
usually O
prefer O
use O
their O
cars O
. O

Public O
transport O
usually B-INCORRECT
is B-INCORRECT
restrected B-INCORRECT
with B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
timetables O
and O
you O
only B-INCORRECT
may B-INCORRECT
use O
in B-INCORRECT
moment B-INCORRECT
that O
timetable O
let B-INCORRECT
. O

For O
this O
way B-INCORRECT
, O
many O
people O
do O
n't O
like O
to O
use O
the B-INCORRECT
public O
transport O
because O
they O
want O
move B-INCORRECT
themselves B-INCORRECT
when O
need O
. B-INCORRECT

By B-INCORRECT
the O
other O
hand O
, O
public O
transport O
is O
better O
for O
environment O
because O
pollution O
lesser B-INCORRECT
than O
using O
your O
own O
car O
. O

Finally O
, O
in O
the O
future O
commodity O
of O
people O
maybe B-INCORRECT
is B-INCORRECT
going O
to O
determinate B-INCORRECT
most O
use O
cars O
than O
public O
transport O
. O

Susan O
is O
a O
little O
dragon O

Her O

more O
precise O

She O
does O

every O
day O
after O

Of O
course O
, O
she O

also B-INCORRECT

Dear O
Paul O
! O

I O
haven't O
written O
you B-INCORRECT
for O
ages O
but B-INCORRECT
was O
very O
busy O
because O
of O
the B-INCORRECT
exams O
at O
University O
. O

What O
about O
you?What B-INCORRECT
's O
new O
in O
Brazil?As B-INCORRECT
you O
know O
, B-INCORRECT
my O
friend O
John O
asked O
me O
to O
help O
him O
with O
the B-INCORRECT
organization O
at B-INCORRECT
concert O
which O
was O
performed B-INCORRECT
last O
month O
. O

So O
I O
was O
there O
something B-INCORRECT
like O
staff B-INCORRECT
. O

My O
work O
consisted O
of O
making O
press O
advertising O
, O
providing O
all O
ticket B-INCORRECT
food O
for O
musicians O
and O
things O
like O
that O
. O

I O
got O
two O
free O
V.I.P O
tickets O
, O
so O
took O
my O
girlfriend O
and O
we O
were O
there O
together O
. O

When O
the O
concert O
finished O
, O
we O
went O
to O
cloakroom B-INCORRECT
get O
signatures B-INCORRECT
from O
musicians O
. O

I O
felt O
like O
a O
star!Crowded B-INCORRECT
of O
people O
were O
waiting O
in O
front O
the B-INCORRECT
cloakroom B-INCORRECT
for O
signatures B-INCORRECT
, O
but O
only O
me O
and O
my O
sweety B-INCORRECT
girlfriend O
got O
them O
. O

People O
were O
so O
envious O
... O
I O
liked O
it!It B-INCORRECT
was O
fantastic B-INCORRECT
experience O
. O

Next O
time O
I B-INCORRECT
would O
like O
to O
do O
something O
similar O
and O
you O
should O
try O
it O
as O
well O
. O
You O
will O
earn O
nice B-INCORRECT
money O
have O
cultural B-INCORRECT
experience O

It O
's O
a O
dual O
effect O
! O

Hope O
to O
see O
you O
soon O

The B-INCORRECT
advertising B-INCORRECT
is O
everysite B-INCORRECT
. O

There O
are O
adds B-INCORRECT
in B-INCORRECT
TV O
, O
radio B-INCORRECT
bus B-INCORRECT
streets B-INCORRECT
... O

In O
spite O
of O
this O
range O
media O
, O
the B-INCORRECT
TV O
continues O
being B-INCORRECT
most O
important O
means O
communication O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
people O
think O
that B-INCORRECT
there O
are O
too O
many O
adds B-INCORRECT
on O
television O
but B-INCORRECT
, O
is O
like B-INCORRECT
? O

On O
one B-INCORRECT
hand O
, B-INCORRECT
it O
's O
true O
that O
programme O
or O
series O
which O
we O
see B-INCORRECT
has O
a O
lot O
of O
mentions O
to B-INCORRECT
products O
services O
. O

There O
can O
be O
people O
tired O
of O
so O
much O
advertising O
contents B-INCORRECT
but O
this O
is O
completely O
necessary O
. O

There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
products O
which O
have O
to O
be O
announced B-INCORRECT
and O
messages O
report O
people O
. O

The B-INCORRECT
TV O
is O
the O
most O
accesible B-INCORRECT
way B-INCORRECT
of O
communication O
and O
people O
can O
see O
messagen B-INCORRECT
on B-INCORRECT
this O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
behind O
one O
add B-INCORRECT
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
: O
industry O
. O

In O
one O
add B-INCORRECT
there O
are O
, O
for O
example O
the O
publicist O
's O
work O
companies O
investments B-INCORRECT
future O
sales O
product O
or O
service O
life O
... O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
adds B-INCORRECT
in B-INCORRECT
TV O
but O
they O
necessary O
and O
beneficial O
for O
everyone O
. O

My O
favourite O
season O
of O
the O
year O
is O
summer O
. O

Why O
am B-INCORRECT
I O
making B-INCORRECT
this O
choice O
you O
clearly O
can O
ask O
, B-INCORRECT
love O
sun O
and O
good O
weather O
. O

Yes O
it B-INCORRECT
is O
true O
that O
during O
summer O
the O
temperature O
very O
hot O
and O
you O
can O
rarely O
stay O
near B-INCORRECT
sun O
because O
finish B-INCORRECT
t B-INCORRECT
be B-INCORRECT
burn B-INCORRECT
by O
. O

In O
spite O
of O
this O
, O
summer O
is O
a O
very O
good O
moment B-INCORRECT
to O
enjoy O
little B-INCORRECT
things O
life O
gives O
us O
and O
have O
fun O
with O
them O
. O

During O
summer O
I O
love O
to O
go O
the O
beach O
and O
having B-INCORRECT
sunbathing O
with O
my O
friends O
other B-INCORRECT
than B-INCORRECT
getting B-INCORRECT
fun O
them O
playing O
volleyball O
or O
run B-INCORRECT
inside B-INCORRECT
water O
of O
sea O
! O

I O
think O
those O
activities O
are O
very O
regenerating O
and O
they O
make O
you O
forget O
about O
all O
the O
warmness B-INCORRECT
of O
summer O
. O

Furthermore O
you B-INCORRECT
can O
sleep O
more O
than O
the O
other O
days O
of O
year O
and O
this O
make B-INCORRECT
feel O
relaxed O
. O

I O
really O
like O
to O
explore O
nature O
during O
summer O
too O
. O

The O
wonderful O
colours O
of O
flowers O
with B-INCORRECT
the O
sunshine O
are O
fabulous O
. O

I O
consider O
myself O

tiring O
day O
, O
but O
Tom O
felt O
he O
achieved O
something O
really O
good O
. O

He O
finally O
, O
after O
5 O
years O
won O
swimming B-INCORRECT
competition O
. O

It O
was B-INCORRECT
really O
importatnt B-INCORRECT
for B-INCORRECT
him O
because O
he O
training O
5 O
long O
years O
since O
15 O
and O
haven't B-INCORRECT
got B-INCORRECT
any B-INCORRECT
achievements B-INCORRECT
. O

He O
was O
very O
happy O
and O
he O
decided O
to O
celebrate O
. O

He O
invited O
all O
his O
friends O
from O
team B-INCORRECT
and O
made B-INCORRECT
a O
party O
. O

Tom O
wanted O
Mel O
, O
his O
girlfriend O
to O
come O
too O
. O

She O
was O
really O
proud O
of O
him O
. O

She O
was B-INCORRECT
dreaming B-INCORRECT
about B-INCORRECT
being O
his O
wife O
. O

She O
wanted O
to O
be O
his O
wife O
so O
bad B-INCORRECT
. O

But O
he O
did O
n't O
love O
her O
enough O
. O

He O
wanted O
to O
break O
up O
with O
her O
at O
that O
party O
. O

He O
was O
waiting O
2 O
hours O
for O
her O
. O

He O
hated O
that O
she O
is B-INCORRECT
always O
late O
. O

That O
was O
the O
main O
reason O
he O
wanted O
to O
end O
it O
up B-INCORRECT
. O

When O
Mel O
came O
she O
looked O
gorgeous O
. O

And O
when O
he O
saw O
her O
, O
his O
heart O
started O
to O
beating B-INCORRECT
faster O
and O
. O

But O
time O
's B-INCORRECT
up O
. O

He O
got O
closer O
to O
her O
and O
told O
everything O
. O

Mel O
looked O
sadly O
at O
Tom O
, O
then O
said O
: O
" O
I O
'm O
pregnant O
... O
and O
got B-INCORRECT
out B-INCORRECT
of B-INCORRECT
his O
home O
. O

He O
followed O
and O
apoligized B-INCORRECT
her O
. O

He O
said O
he O
was O
drunk O
and O
did O
n't O
know O
what O
saying O
. O

Then O
he O
hugged O
her O
. O

He O
said O
he O
loved O
her O
and O
kissed O
forehead O
. O

He O
had O
to O
stay O
with O
her O
because O
of O
... O
the O
baby O
. O

He O
could O
n't O
just O
leave O
her O
carrying O
his O
baby O
! O

No O
! O
He O
has B-INCORRECT
never O
acted O
like O
this O
. O

He O
knew O
that O
he O
had O
to O
stay O
with O
her O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
life O
and O
raise O
baby O
. O

He O
decided O
to O
give O
swimming O
up O
and O
started B-INCORRECT
taking B-INCORRECT
care O
of O
Mel O
. O

One O
day O
Mel O
was O
feeling O
really O
bad O
so O
Tom O
took O
her O
to O
the O
hospital O
. O

He O
felt O
that O
something O
bad O
was O
going O
to O
happen O
. O

And O
he O
was O
right O
. O

Mel O
has B-INCORRECT
lost O
the O
baby O
. O

Tom O
had O
to O
make O
a O
hard O
decision O
. O

His O
life O
was O
going O
to O
change O
. O

Mel O
was O
crying O
all O
day O
and O
Tom O
could O
n't O
stand O
it O
. O

He O
has B-INCORRECT
broken B-INCORRECT
up O
with O
Mel O
and O
it O
made O
her O
much O
more O
sad O
. O

He O
did O
n't O
care O
. O

He O
thought O
it O
was O
her O
fault O
that O
she O
has B-INCORRECT
lost O
their O
little O
human O
. O

Gliding O
in O
the O
waves O

Even O
if O
I O
am O
not O
a B-INCORRECT
very O
interested O
in O
training O
, O
the O
sport O
really O
prefer O
to O
practice B-INCORRECT
is O
swimming O
. O

The O
sensation O
of O
being O
embraced O
by O
the O
water O
, O
feeling O
body O
quite O
without O
weigh O
able O
to O
do B-INCORRECT
a O
lot O
movement B-INCORRECT
that O
are O
impossible O
while O
in O
air O
is B-INCORRECT
wonderful O
state O
mind O
. O

I O
started O
to O
practice O
swimming O
in O
pool B-INCORRECT
because O
was O
n't O
able O
swim O
at O
all O
, O
and O
wanted O
learn O
. O

I O
have B-INCORRECT
been B-INCORRECT
taking B-INCORRECT
lessons O
for O
six O
months O
, O
so B-INCORRECT
improved O
much B-INCORRECT
my B-INCORRECT
abilities B-INCORRECT
. O

If O
you O
are O
not O
a O
good O
swimmer O
, O
lose O
the B-INCORRECT
big B-INCORRECT
part B-INCORRECT
of B-INCORRECT
pleasure O
enjoying O
water O
both B-INCORRECT
in O
sea O
or O
pool B-INCORRECT
. O

Practice B-INCORRECT
swimming B-INCORRECT
is O
quite O
hard O
work O
, O
especially O
if O
you O
need O
to O
learn O
the O
basic O
movements O
but O
it O
a O
very O
relaxing O
activity O
. O

I O
recommend O
that O
you O
do O
n't O
have B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
give O
up O
before O
trying O
, O
because O
is B-INCORRECT
fairly O
simple O
and O
it O
can O
gives B-INCORRECT
a O
lot O
of O
satisfactions B-INCORRECT
! O

Your O
efforts O
will O
be O
prized B-INCORRECT
by B-INCORRECT
succeeding B-INCORRECT
, O
and O
you O
can O
obtain B-INCORRECT
it O
with B-INCORRECT
practice O
. O

·Introduction O

This O
report O
will O
examine O
the O
different O
activities O
we O
can O
do O
in O
our O
leisure O
time O
Castelldefels O
. O

·Activities O
to O
kill B-INCORRECT
time O

As O
our O
town O
is O
well O
- O
known O
for O
magnificul B-INCORRECT
beaches O
along O
the O
Mediterranean O
coast O
and O
Olympic O
Canal O
of O
Castelldefels O
, O
many O
foreign O
or B-INCORRECT
local O
people O
come O
here O
to O
do O
activities O
like O
kitesurfing O
windsurfing O
on B-INCORRECT
beah B-INCORRECT
canoening B-INCORRECT
aquatic B-INCORRECT
skiing B-INCORRECT
. O

These O
activities O
are O
the O
most O
popular O
and O
expensive O
too O
. O

However O
, O
I O
fully O
recommend O
them O
especially O
for O
sporty O
adventurous O
and O
young O
people O
. O

·Others B-INCORRECT
ideas O
to B-INCORRECT
have B-INCORRECT
fun O

In O
Castelldefels O
, B-INCORRECT
there O
are O
other O
activities O
less B-INCORRECT
popular O
but O
cheaper O
for B-INCORRECT
instance O
: O
free O
zumba O
masterclass O
yoga B-INCORRECT
beach B-INCORRECT
running O
... O
as O
sports O
and O
social O
library O
group O
theatre O

As O
I O
said O
, O
these O
activities O
are O
not O
as O
popular O
the O
of B-INCORRECT
Olympic O
Canal O
and O
beach O
but O
their O
success O
is O
increasing O
more O
. O

·Recommendation O

So O
, O
finally O
I B-INCORRECT
suggest O
that O
it O
would O
be O
a O
great O
idea O
to O
combine O
the O
different O
types O
of O
activities O
both O
popular B-INCORRECT
and O
newest O
. O

If O
you O
tried O
all O
the O
activities O
, B-INCORRECT
would O
spend B-INCORRECT
a O
great O
time O
here O
in O
Castelldefels O
! O

it B-INCORRECT
's O
small O
but O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
servicies B-INCORRECT
and O
transport O
. O

You O
have O
to O
take B-INCORRECT
a O
bus O
because O
it O
is O
more O
economical O
than O
taxi O
. O

The O
bus O
stops O
at O
the B-INCORRECT
Salou O
station O
. O

When O
you B-INCORRECT
get O
off O

Nowadays O
there B-INCORRECT
are O
many O
people O
that B-INCORRECT
learning O
foreign O
language B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
for B-INCORRECT
me O
is B-INCORRECT
a O
good O
thing O
more O
learn B-INCORRECT
this B-INCORRECT
but O
it O
worth O
? O

Firstly O
, O
there O
are O
more O
multinational O
companies O
that O
need O
people O
to B-INCORRECT
speak O
other O
languages O
so O
means O
the B-INCORRECT
who O
know O
foreign B-INCORRECT
language O
have O
opportunities O
get O
a O
job O
in O
important B-INCORRECT
or O
will O
chances O
of O
being O
promoted O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, B-INCORRECT
are B-INCORRECT
more O
benefits O
for B-INCORRECT
example O
if O
you O
want O
to O
travel O
another O
a B-INCORRECT
country O
is B-INCORRECT
very O
useful O
know O
different O
language O
because O
can O
understand O
all B-INCORRECT
without O
complications O
. O

Finally O
, O
learning O
another O
language O
gives O
the O
learner O
ability O
to O
step O
inside O
mind O
and O
context O
of O
that O
other O
culture O
. O

Today O
globalization B-INCORRECT
is O
bringing O
the B-INCORRECT
world O
more B-INCORRECT
close B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
that B-INCORRECT
means O
there O
are O
possibilities O
to O
have O
contact O
with O
other O
cultures O
for O
example O
in B-INCORRECT
literature O
poetry O
films O
TV O
programs O
music O
or O
some O
aspect O
of O
culture O
. O

On O
balance O
, O
learning O
foreign O
languages O
is O
very O
positive O
on B-INCORRECT
different O
aspect B-INCORRECT
so O
if O
you O
have O
the O
positivity B-INCORRECT
of O
a O
new O
language O
do B-INCORRECT
it O
because O
will O
bring O
many O
benefits O

writing O
to O

package O
received O
on O
Monday O
last O
week O
. O

I O
ordered O
two O
batteries O
model B-INCORRECT
002545 O
because B-INCORRECT
my O

needs O
this O
kind O
of O
battery O
, O
but O
have O
only O
received O
one O
001212 O
. O

One O
month O

I B-INCORRECT
ordered O
two O

model B-INCORRECT
002545 O
on B-INCORRECT
your O
online O

. O

I O
have O
a O
mobile O
model B-INCORRECT
Nokia B-INCORRECT
1214 B-INCORRECT
which O
needs O

002545 O
. O

The O

To O

problem O
I B-INCORRECT
would O

The O

error O
has B-INCORRECT
been B-INCORRECT
made O

The O
aim O
of O
this O
report O
is O
to O
evaluate O
both O
bad O
effects B-INCORRECT
and O
good O
from B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
users'opinions B-INCORRECT
in B-INCORRECT
Active O
Leisure O
Club O
last B-INCORRECT
time B-INCORRECT
. O

First O
, B-INCORRECT
people O
in O
this O
area O
have B-INCORRECT
actually O
found O
a O
suitable O
place O
to O
enjoy O
their O
time O
through O
wide O
range O
of O
activities O
games O
which O
are O
held O
creatively O
and O
effectively O
been B-INCORRECT
for O
different O
ages O
. O

Besides O
, O
it O
has O
enough O
modern O
facilities O
to O
serve O
the B-INCORRECT
users O
in O
peak O
hours O
and O
guiders B-INCORRECT
are O
everywhere O
ready O
give B-INCORRECT
a B-INCORRECT
help O
. O

However O
, O
only B-INCORRECT
one O
thing O
that O
we O
dislike O

With O
the B-INCORRECT
purpose O
to B-INCORRECT
actract B-INCORRECT
more O
peole B-INCORRECT
join O
in B-INCORRECT
club O
, O
besises B-INCORRECT
its O
good O
points O
I O
will B-INCORRECT
highly O
recommend O
that O
they O
should O
arrange O
time O
suitably O
and O
avoi B-INCORRECT
hold O
acivities B-INCORRECT
avoid O
problems O

Given O
is O
a O
diagram O
introducing O
the O
procedures O
of B-INCORRECT
making O
bank O
notes O
. O

Desgin B-INCORRECT
the O
bank O
notes O
are B-INCORRECT
first O
and O
indispensable O
step O
. O

Peple B-INCORRECT
should O
decide O
the O
background O
colour O
and O
thw B-INCORRECT
artwork O
while B-INCORRECT
they O
have O
to O
consider O
security O
issues O
. O

Then O
, O
skilled O
machinists O
would B-INCORRECT
prepare O
the O
metal O
plates O
in O
order O
to O
go O
next O
step O
. O

The O
third O
section B-INCORRECT
is O
to O
print O
the O
prepared O
bank O
notes O
. O

Usually O
there O
will O
be O
50 O
ban B-INCORRECT
notes O
per O
sheet O
. O

The O
colour O
will O
print B-INCORRECT
on O
the B-INCORRECT
both O
sides O
and O
every O
notes B-INCORRECT
has O
their B-INCORRECT
unique O
ink O
also B-INCORRECT
images O
be O
slightly O
raised O
. O

After O
that O
, B-INCORRECT
it B-INCORRECT
comes O
to B-INCORRECT
the O
most O
significant O
stage O
is O
inspect B-INCORRECT
quality O
of O
printed O
sheets O
. O

People O
usually O
divided B-INCORRECT
the O
quality O
into O
three O
parts O
: O
Good B-INCORRECT
, O
Partially B-INCORRECT
damaged O
and O
bad O
sheets O
. O

As O
for O
good O
quality O
sheets B-INCORRECT
and O
partially O
damaged O
but O
still O
, B-INCORRECT
people O
will O
cut O
them O
separately B-INCORRECT
pack O
together O
in O
order O
to O
dispacting B-INCORRECT
distributing B-INCORRECT
the O
bank O
notes O
. O

If O
the O
partially O
damaged O
sheets O
are O
bad O
, O
they O
will O
be O
treated O
as O
which O
securely O
distoryed B-INCORRECT
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
the O
diagram O
gives O
a B-INCORRECT
quite O
explicit B-INCORRECT
process O

Eventhough B-INCORRECT
it O

Beginings O

Everything O
began O
a O
few O
years O
before B-INCORRECT
, O
when O
Alfred O
The B-INCORRECT
Major B-INCORRECT
read O
an O
article O
about O
the O
importance O
of O
surroundings O
in B-INCORRECT
health B-INCORRECT
and O
happinness B-INCORRECT
people O
. O

He O
started O
to O
think O
how B-INCORRECT
he O
could O
get B-INCORRECT
better B-INCORRECT
our O
lives O
and O
found O
a O
solution O
. O

A O
concerned O
population O

While O
youngsters O
use O
their O
time O
trying O
to O
get B-INCORRECT
concerned B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
oldest O
people O
from B-INCORRECT
de B-INCORRECT
village O
about O
importance O
of O
care O
our O
surroundings O
, O
middle O
- O
aged O
planted B-INCORRECT
many O
trees O
around O
and O
cleaned O
floor O
public O
places O
making O
a B-INCORRECT
more O
attractive O
place O
live O
than B-INCORRECT
we O
used O
have O
. O

Easy O
recycling O

Local B-INCORRECT
authorities O
helped O
this O
initiative O
creating B-INCORRECT
some O
places O
for O
people O
to B-INCORRECT
leave O
their O
rubbish O
in O
order O
be O
taken O
the O
recycling O
center O
with O
purpose O
of O
giving O
a O
new O
life O
our O
waste O
. O

The O
results O

As O
a O
result O
of O
this O
attitude O
, O
since O
Alfred O
had O
great O
idea O
we O
enjoy B-INCORRECT
one O
the O
cleanest O
villages O
in O
area O
. O

People O
now O
is B-INCORRECT
worried O
about O
the O
future O
of O
our O
planet O
and O
an O
association O
has O
been O
created O
in O
order O
to O
promote O
care O
, O
Green O
Planet O
called O
. O

We O
want O
a O
happy O
Earth O
. O

Hello O
Luis O
Blanco O
, O

I O
'm O
writing O
you B-INCORRECT
about O
the O
staff O
recruitment O
for O
" O
New O
Cloud O
Generation O
project O
. O

So O
we O
need O
your O
help O
with O
some O
questions O
about O
the O
process O
. O

For O
your O
information O
, O
we O
are O
looking O
for O
people O
with O
three O
years O
of B-INCORRECT
experience O
in O
similar O
projects O
who O
engineers O
and O
also O
have O
a B-INCORRECT
high B-INCORRECT
team B-INCORRECT
work B-INCORRECT
skill B-INCORRECT
. O

We O
also O
value B-INCORRECT
that O
they O
have O
specialised O
studies O
in O
Cloud O
technology O
, O
and O
hosting O
management O
. O

However O
it B-INCORRECT
's O
possible O
that O
we O
do B-INCORRECT
n't O
find O
enough O
people O
with O
profile O
so B-INCORRECT
, O
could O
accept O
one O
year O
of B-INCORRECT
experience O
. O

Is O
it O
possible O
to O
do B-INCORRECT
the O
meeting O
this O
week O
? O

When O
and O
where O
do B-INCORRECT
you O
prefer O
? O
( O
Remember O
that O
I O
work O
from O
8 O
a.m O
to O
6 O
p.m O
) O
suggest O
we O
can B-INCORRECT
the O
meeting O
at O
your O
office O
, O
so O
n't O
have O
move B-INCORRECT
another O
place O
. O

Finally O
I B-INCORRECT
need O
you O
to O
prepare O
some O
profiles O
that B-INCORRECT
think O
the O
staff O
of O
New O
Cloud O
Generation O
should O
have O
, O
and O
please O
tell B-INCORRECT
me O
if O
find O
another O
different O
request O
than O
before O
in O
e O
- O
mail O
. O

Please O
, O
answer O
me O
with O
the O
information O
as O
soon O
possible O
. O

Dear O
Paul O
, O

What O
's O
up O
? O

Do O
you O
remember O
when O
I O
told O
had O
been O
helped B-INCORRECT
at O
a O
concert O
? O

It O
was O
really B-INCORRECT
exciting O
and O
unforgettable O
experience O
I O
enjoy B-INCORRECT
that B-INCORRECT
very O
much O
. O

You O
probably O
wo O
n't O
believe O
me O
but B-INCORRECT
I B-INCORRECT
met O
all O
members B-INCORRECT
of O
Dżem O
band O
, B-INCORRECT
talked O
to O
them O
and O
we O
had O
lunch O
together O
they B-INCORRECT
're O
very O
nice O
men O
. O
Because O
helping O
the O
best O
place O
during O
concert O
have O
their O
authographs B-INCORRECT
on O
newest B-INCORRECT
record O
did O
many O
duties O
none O
were O
unpleasant O

In O
general O
I B-INCORRECT
had O
only O
one O
duty O
that B-INCORRECT
is B-INCORRECT
checking O
quest B-INCORRECT
list O
, B-INCORRECT
above B-INCORRECT
to O
help O
in B-INCORRECT
cleaning O
area B-INCORRECT
after O
the O
concert O
. O

But O
that O
concert O
was O
worth O
of B-INCORRECT
my O
work O
, O
so O
I O
hope O
will O
be O
invited O
to O
their O
next O
event O
. O

Working O
for O
them O
was O
a O
real O
pleasure O
. O

I O
suppose O
we O
'll O
see O
each O
other O
soon O
and O
be O
capable B-INCORRECT
of B-INCORRECT
talking B-INCORRECT
to O
you O
about O
this O
experience O
. O

Love O

Report O
: O

The O
aim O
of O
this O
report O
is O
to O
give O
you O
my O
personal O
point O
view O
the O
course O
I O
did O
in B-INCORRECT
your O
branch O
Madrid O
last O
month O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to B-INCORRECT
give O
you O
some O
suggestions O
think O
it B-INCORRECT
be O
worth O
take B-INCORRECT
into O
account O
for O
the O
next O
course O
will O
place O
year O
. O

First O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
stand O
out O
the O
outstanding O
classmates O
there O
were O
in O
class O
. O

They O
were O
not O
only O
really O
clever O
people O
but B-INCORRECT
also O
excellent O
co O
- O
workers O
. O

Working O
collaboratively O
is O
, O
in O
fact O
the O
most O
interesting O
way O
of O
learning O
any O
subject O
even B-INCORRECT
English O
. O

Second O
, O
the O
teachers O
were B-INCORRECT
really O
good O
skills B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
teach B-INCORRECT
. O

They O
managed O
to O
encourage O
all O
of O
us O
every O
day O
. O

This O
way O
we B-INCORRECT
made O
the O
most O
of O
us B-INCORRECT
and O
never O
gave O
up O
improving O
our O
English O
level O
. O

Third O
, O
phonetic B-INCORRECT
classes O
scheduled O
on O
Fridays O
came O
really B-INCORRECT
in B-INCORRECT
handy O
. O

They O
helped O
me O
to O
pronounce O
words O
better O
than O
before O
starting O
the O
course O
. O

However O
, O
in O
my O
opinion O
there B-INCORRECT
should O
have O
been O
at O
least O
one O
native O
teacher B-INCORRECT
the O
's B-INCORRECT
team O
. O

This B-INCORRECT
way O
we B-INCORRECT
had B-INCORRECT
been O
able O
to O
hear O
a O
native O
speaker O
and O
I O
think O
it O
would O
have O
worth O
practising O
. O

To O
wrap O
up O
the B-INCORRECT
report O
just B-INCORRECT
say O
that O
on B-INCORRECT
whole O
course O
was O
fantastic O
and O
I O
am O
looking O
forward O
to O
signing O
it B-INCORRECT
again O
next O
year O
. O

Yours O
sincerely O
, O

Juan O
Orozco O

I O
am O
keen O
on O
cinema O
thus B-INCORRECT
love O
to O
watch O
all O
types O
of O
fims B-INCORRECT
. O

But O
, O
what O
films O
are O
in O
my O
Top O
100 O
list O
? O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
Babel O
is O
a B-INCORRECT
fascinating O
film O
with O
dramatic O
and O
thrilling O
storyline O
that O
top O
100 O
best O
movies O
. O

I O
really O
enjoy O
it O
because O
the O
plot O
is O
original O
and O
shows O
different B-INCORRECT
life O
stories O
of O
moving O
characters O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
I O
think O
that O
the O
settings O
are O
very O
reallistic B-INCORRECT
and O
actors O
had B-INCORRECT
a O
great O
performance O
. O

Therefore O
, O
I O
recommend O
that O
drama O
genre O
lovers O
watch O
Babel O
as O
its O
message O
will O
move O
you O
. O

It O
reveals O
that O
our O
feelings O
cross O
the O
boundaries O
of O
all O
cultures O
and O
we O
are O
connected O
to O
each O
other O
. O

My O
name O
is O
Mohamed O
El O
- O
Shamoun O
. O

I O
am O
20 O
years O
old O
, O
living B-INCORRECT
in O
Port O
- O
Said O
Egypt O
. O

I O
am O
a O
student O
in O
the O
3rd O
year O
of O
faculty O
medicine O
Port B-INCORRECT
- O
Said O
University O
. O

My O
father O
works O
as O
a O
teacher O
and O
so O
does O
my O
mother O
. O

I O
have O
one O
brother O
and O
sister O
. O

I O
have O
been O
doing O
Judo O
for O
the O
past O
11 O
years O
with B-INCORRECT
a O
lot O
of O
prizes O
. O

My O
hobbies O
are O
travelling O
, O
reading O
stories O
and O
writing O
my O
thoughts O
. O

I O
am O
interested O
in O
scientific O
research O
and O
analyzing O
information O
so B-INCORRECT
taking O
a O
lot O
of O
courses O
training O
this O
field O
as B-INCORRECT
want O
to O
be O
one O
the O
greatest O
researchers O
world O
addition O
becoming O
member O
World O
Health O
Organization O
( O
WHO O
) O
. O

It O
is O
n't O
just O
a O
dream O
in O
my O
mind O
but B-INCORRECT
I O
work O
hard O
to O
make O
this O
come O
true O
. O

Last B-INCORRECT
two O
years O
, O
I O
worked B-INCORRECT
in O
many O
places O
such B-INCORRECT
as O
a O
pharmacy O
restaurant O
and O
the B-INCORRECT
water O
purification O
company O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
work O
is O
everything O
and O
experience O
can O
make B-INCORRECT
miracles O
in O
our O
life B-INCORRECT
so O
chose O
this O
program O
as B-INCORRECT
want O
to O
learn O
study O
, O
know O
more O
. O

In O
my O
childhood O
, O
dream O
was O
to O
become O
an O
engineer O
but B-INCORRECT
when O
I O
changed O
career O
medicine O
realized O
that O
Allah O
chose O
the O
best O
for O
me O
and O
personality O
. O

When O
I O
work O
anything B-INCORRECT
feel O
that O
have O
the O
world O
in O
my O
hand O
so B-INCORRECT
can O
do O
for O
people O
. O

One O
of O
my O
goals O
in O
the B-INCORRECT
life O
is O
to O
invent O
an O
effective O
drug O
for O
one O
incurable O
like B-INCORRECT
cancer O
, O
AIDS O
and O
hepatitis O
. O

I O
asked B-INCORRECT
myself O
many O
times O
what O
is O
the O
aim O
of O
our B-INCORRECT
life O
? O

And O
what O
are O
the O
benefits O
of O
work O
and O
study O
? O

But O
if O
you O
see B-INCORRECT
your O
world O
and O
realize O
it O
well O
, O
will O
be O
deserved O
from O
everyone O
to O
work O
so O
hard O
achieve O
their O
hopes O
. O

I O
learnt O
from O
Research B-INCORRECT
that O
you O
can O
do O
everything O
in B-INCORRECT
anytime B-INCORRECT
addition O
a B-INCORRECT
little O
tired O
change O
the B-INCORRECT
life O
for O
better O
. O

I O
like O
travelling B-INCORRECT
and O
visiting O
new O
places O
in O
my B-INCORRECT
country O
dream O
is O
to O
all O
the B-INCORRECT
countries O
world O
also B-INCORRECT
, O
attended B-INCORRECT
a O
lot O
of O
conferences O
field O
so B-INCORRECT
think O
this O
program O
chance O
for O
experience O
which O
will O
help O
inspire O
me O
community O
services B-INCORRECT
development B-INCORRECT
society O
as B-INCORRECT
hope O
come O
back O
teach O
others O
what O
learn B-INCORRECT
. O

I O
am O
writing O
with O
reference O
to O
the O
post B-INCORRECT
of B-INCORRECT
job O
as O
a B-INCORRECT
camp O
monitor O
that O
you O
require O
in O
summer B-INCORRECT
. O

I O
have B-INCORRECT
seen B-INCORRECT
your O
advert B-INCORRECT
this O
morning O
and O
am O
really O
interested O
in O
it O
. O

Although O
I O
am O
a O
young O
girl O
, O
think O
quialified B-INCORRECT
person O
for O
the O
post O
. O

I O
am O
a O
preschool O
teacher O
and O
have O
experience O
looking O
after O
chilren B-INCORRECT
from O
3 O
to O
twelve B-INCORRECT
yeras B-INCORRECT
old O
. O
consired B-INCORRECT
myself O
quite O
patient O
fun O
that B-INCORRECT
in B-INCORRECT
my O
opinion O
, O
they O
are O
two O
qualities B-INCORRECT
highly B-INCORRECT
necessary B-INCORRECT
for O
this O
kind O
of O
job O

I O
am O
good O
too B-INCORRECT
at B-INCORRECT
working B-INCORRECT
in B-INCORRECT
a B-INCORRECT
team B-INCORRECT
. O

I O
do O
not O
like O
to O
be O
or B-INCORRECT
feel O
alone B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
this B-INCORRECT
could O
one O
of O
my O
great O
weakness B-INCORRECT
. O

I O
really O
love O
being O
with O
people O
all O
the O
time O
. O

I O
do O
not O
think O
being O
young O
will O
be O
a O
problem O
. O

Instead O
I B-INCORRECT
believe O
it O
is O
an O
advantage O
. O

Young O
people O
are O
usually O
hard O
- O
working O
and O
active O
person B-INCORRECT
. O

If O
you O
require O
any O
further O
information O
, O
please O
do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
contact O
me O
. O

I O
enclose O
my O
curriculum O
vitae O
with O
telephone O
number O
. O
would O
be O
grateful O
if O
you O
could O
give O
me O
an O
interview O
at O
your O
earliest O
convenience O

I O
would O
be B-INCORRECT
really O
appreciate O
it O
because O
am O
looking O
forward O
to O
starting O
work O
. O

Is O
there O
a O
future O
for O
Privately B-INCORRECT
owned O
cars O
? O

To O
be O
honest O
, O
I O
am O
not O
sure O
. O

Although O
privately O
oned B-INCORRECT
cars O
are O
more O
and O
popular O
, O
they O
increasingly O
becoming O
a O
common O
asset O
even O
in O
developing O
countries O
it O
is O
not O
likely O
that O
this O
means O
of O
transport O
can O
be O
the O
future O
. O

Most O
people O
today O
realize O
that O
in B-INCORRECT
our O
cities O
and O
planet O
there O
ia B-INCORRECT
an O
increasing O
problem O
of O
space O
pollution O
. O

Carbon O
based B-INCORRECT
fuels O
will O
not O
last O
forever O
. O

I O
would O
say O
that O
most B-INCORRECT
probably O
private B-INCORRECT
care B-INCORRECT
are O
not O
" O
sustainables B-INCORRECT
in O
the O
long O
term O
, O
and O
it O
will O
be O
necessary O
to O
revert O
some O
sort O
of O
public O
transport O
. O

The O
population O
growth B-INCORRECT
forecast O
tells O
us O
that O
in B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
next O
35 O
years O
world O
will O
grow O
of B-INCORRECT
a O
staggering O
3 O
billions B-INCORRECT
human O
beings O
. O

I O
know O
that O
it O
is O
nice O
to O
dream O
a B-INCORRECT
future O
of O
technological O
people O
flying O
around O
, O
each O
them O
with O
its B-INCORRECT
own O
private B-INCORRECT
small B-INCORRECT
helicopter O
. O

But O
it O
is O
not O
going O
to O
happen O
. O

I O
guess O
that O
in O
our O
future O
there O
are B-INCORRECT
no O
helicopters O
, O
and O
not O
even O
cars B-INCORRECT
. O

States O
and O
local O
authorities O
will O
have O
to O
tackle O
the O
problem O
provide O
public O
with O
a O
better O
alternative O
. O
T O

he O
price O
for O
independent O
transport O
will O
grow B-INCORRECT
dramatically O
. O

I O
reckon B-INCORRECT
that O
will O
change O
the O
habits O
of O
public O
. O

Even O
though O
we O
will O
have O
to O
read O
the O
timetable O
and O
learn O
again O
be O
on O
time O
, O
nice O
old O
train O
could O
become O
important O
. O

Imagine O
this O
picture O
: O
the O
first O
class O
of O
semester O
, O
students O
are O
yawning O
and O
do O
not O
pay O
attention O
on B-INCORRECT
teacher O
; B-INCORRECT
while O
ask B-INCORRECT
for O
answer O
can O
because O
they O
totally O
remember O
what O
have B-INCORRECT
studied O
in B-INCORRECT
last O
. O

Students O
could O
receive O
a O
better O
, O
more O
efficient O
education O
if O
they O
spend B-INCORRECT
11 O
months O
year O
studying B-INCORRECT
partly B-INCORRECT
because O
of B-INCORRECT
after B-INCORRECT
the O
long B-INCORRECT
vacation O
students O
will O
not O
remember O
knowledge O
have B-INCORRECT
learned O
let B-INCORRECT
used O
to O
fun O
instead O
study B-INCORRECT
and O
some O
difficult O
courses O
should O
be O
continually O
. O

Therefore O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
the O
statement O
that O
students O
could O
receive O
a O
better O
more O
efficient O
education O
if O
they O
spend B-INCORRECT
11 O
months O
year O
studying O
. O

More O
reasons O
and O
detail B-INCORRECT
will O
be O
shed O
light O
on O
in O
the O
following O
paragraphs O
. O

To O
begin O
with O
, B-INCORRECT
there O
is O
a O
general O
consensus O
students B-INCORRECT
will O
forget O
the O
knowledge O
they O
have O
learned O
after O
long O
break O
time B-INCORRECT
. O

For O
example O
, O
on B-INCORRECT
history O
class O
teacher B-INCORRECT
have O
to O
repeat O
teaching O
the O
of O
North O
America O
before O
he B-INCORRECT
start O
teach O
South O
in B-INCORRECT
beginning O
semester O
. O

It O
is O
very O
wasting B-INCORRECT
time B-INCORRECT
and O
not O
efficient O
. O

Next O
to B-INCORRECT
go B-INCORRECT
would O
be O
, O
students O
get O
used O
relax B-INCORRECT
by B-INCORRECT
having O
no O
study O
and O
homework O
in O
the O
long O
vacation O
. O

For O
example O
, O
when O
the O
semester O
start B-INCORRECT
students O
can O
not O
get O
away B-INCORRECT
from B-INCORRECT
sunshine O
beach O
and O
travelling O
. O

In O
the O
class O
, O
students O
will O
recall O
joyful O
time O
they O
had O
instead O
paying B-INCORRECT
attention O
on B-INCORRECT
teacher O
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
some O
difficult O
courses O
should O
be O
continually O
studying B-INCORRECT
rather O
than O
having O
long B-INCORRECT
a B-INCORRECT
break O
time B-INCORRECT
. O

For O
instance O
, B-INCORRECT
learning B-INCORRECT
English O
should O
be O
a O
daily O
education B-INCORRECT
if B-INCORRECT
you O
have O
long O
time O
without O
could O
forget O
the O
vocabulary O
or O
grammar O
. O

In O
a O
nutshell O
, O
based O
on O
aforementioned B-INCORRECT
I B-INCORRECT
totally O
agree O
with O
the O
statement O
that O
students O
could O
receive O
better O
more O
efficient O
education O
if O
they O
spend B-INCORRECT
11 O
months O
year O
studying O
. O

My O
favourite O
sport O
is O
the B-INCORRECT
soccer O
. O

I O
enjoy B-INCORRECT
this O
sport O
since O
was O
a O
child O
, B-INCORRECT
always O
remember O
when O
my O
father O
and O
brother O
teach B-INCORRECT
me O
to O
play O
it O
. O

My O
father O
was O
a O
professional O
soccer O
player O
so B-INCORRECT
I O
think O
that O
inherited O
this O
love O
for O
the B-INCORRECT
. O

I O
played O
soccer O
in O
different O
teams O
my O
neighborhood O
, O
school O
or O
university O
. O

I O
always O
enjoy O
playing O
soccer O
because O
when O
am O
in B-INCORRECT
the O
field O
forget O
all O
problems O
. O

I O
like O
to O
speak O
with O
my O
team B-INCORRECT
partners B-INCORRECT
. O

Together O
we O
analyze O
the O
rival O
team O
and O
choose O
a O
strategy O
to O
win O
match O
. O

when B-INCORRECT
I O
play O
bad B-INCORRECT
feel O
nervous B-INCORRECT
but O
my O
parters B-INCORRECT
give O
me O
their O
unconditional O
support O
. O

that B-INCORRECT
is O
priceless O
. O

I O
know O
the B-INCORRECT
health O
is O
very O
important O
so B-INCORRECT
if O
you O
practise B-INCORRECT
this O
sport O
there O
a O
big B-INCORRECT
probability O
that O
are O
healthy O
. O

So O
if B-INCORRECT
you B-INCORRECT
are O
starting O
this O
sport O
have B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
do O
it O
because O
really B-INCORRECT
like O
. O

if B-INCORRECT
you O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
there B-INCORRECT
are O
many O
options O
to O
practise B-INCORRECT
whatever B-INCORRECT
sports O
. O

The B-INCORRECT
soccer B-INCORRECT
is O
not O
a O
violent O
sport O
but B-INCORRECT
sometimes O
it O
becomes O
. B-INCORRECT

In B-INCORRECT
this B-INCORRECT
way B-INCORRECT
you O
have O
to O
be O
prepared O
for O
anything B-INCORRECT
problem O
. O

Finally O
I B-INCORRECT
advise O
that O
you O
enjoy O
playing O
this O
awesome O
sport O
. O

On O
my O
vacation O
I O
went O

arrived O
to B-INCORRECT
Niagara O
Falls O
city B-INCORRECT
that B-INCORRECT
looks O
like O
a O
ghost O
place B-INCORRECT
. O

It O

much O
to O

. O

I O
was O
amazed O
of B-INCORRECT
how O

the B-INCORRECT

. O

They O
were O
incredible O
amazing B-INCORRECT
and O
beautiful O
. O

I O
take B-INCORRECT

photos O
because O
you O

Something O

say B-INCORRECT
they O
do O
not O
see O
frecuently B-INCORRECT
and O
many O
other O
part B-INCORRECT
my O
family O
. O

In O
conclusion O
I B-INCORRECT
have B-INCORRECT
a O
perfect O
vacation O
where O
saw O
new O
things O
, O
visit B-INCORRECT
awesome O
places O
as B-INCORRECT
Niagara O

and O
Time O
Square O
recieving B-INCORRECT
lot O

soecially B-INCORRECT

delicious B-INCORRECT
food O
. O

Most O
attending B-INCORRECT
students B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
Universities B-INCORRECT
are O
out B-INCORRECT
of B-INCORRECT
the O
city O
where O
they O
used O
live O
, O
so O
need O
an B-INCORRECT
accommodation O
through B-INCORRECT
their O
study B-INCORRECT
years B-INCORRECT
. O

Most O
universities O
provide O
cheap O
accommodations O
such B-INCORRECT
as O
, B-INCORRECT
shared O
rooms O
and O
dormitories O
to B-INCORRECT
their O
students O
lower O
the O
living B-INCORRECT
costs O
where B-INCORRECT
most O
have O
low B-INCORRECT
income O
. O

Other O
students O
who B-INCORRECT
may O
have O
family O
financial O
support O
prefer B-INCORRECT
to O
hire O
an O
apartments B-INCORRECT
live O
independently O

Sharing O
houses O
or O
rooms O
have B-INCORRECT
many O
advantages O
such B-INCORRECT
as O
, B-INCORRECT
cheap B-INCORRECT
safe O
close O
to O
the O
university O
and O
learn B-INCORRECT
how O
share O
everything O
with O
others O
. O
saving B-INCORRECT
money O
time O
will O
be O
more O
Obvious B-INCORRECT
in O
dormitories O
because O
monthly O
payments O
less O
than B-INCORRECT
four O
times O
hiring B-INCORRECT
an O
apartment O
it B-INCORRECT
closer O
is O
efficient O
by B-INCORRECT
reducing O
transportation O
's B-INCORRECT
costs O

In O
spite O
all B-INCORRECT
these O
benefits O
, O
I O
prefer- B-INCORRECT
if O
can O
- O
to O
live O
in O
an O
apartment O
where O
the B-INCORRECT
personality O
is O
very O
important O
for O
me O
. O

Many O
years O
ago O
, B-INCORRECT
I B-INCORRECT
shared O
a B-INCORRECT
friend B-INCORRECT
in B-INCORRECT
room B-INCORRECT
for O
few B-INCORRECT
months O
during B-INCORRECT
course O
outside O
my O
country O
these B-INCORRECT
days O
where B-INCORRECT
worst O
life O
he O
was O
dirty O
speaking B-INCORRECT
loudly O
all O
time B-INCORRECT
and O
did O
not O
share O
the O
budget O
of B-INCORRECT
eating B-INCORRECT
. O
living B-INCORRECT
alone O
will B-INCORRECT
grant O
me O
freedom O
to O
live O
by B-INCORRECT
way O
that O
choose O
still O
friendly B-INCORRECT
with O
others O
without O
exceed O
privacy O
friends O
this B-INCORRECT
matter B-INCORRECT
achieved O
when O
rooms O

they B-INCORRECT
annoying B-INCORRECT
me O

Although O
The B-INCORRECT
federal O
government O
which O
is O
decided O
as O
a O
role O
of O
USA B-INCORRECT
has O
many O
benefits O
according O
to O
reading B-INCORRECT
passage O
, O
the O
lecturer O
believes O
that O
there O
no O
perfect O
. O

The O
powerful B-INCORRECT
of O
the B-INCORRECT
federalism O
which B-INCORRECT
has B-INCORRECT
more O
liberty O
for B-INCORRECT
states O
to O
have O
their O
own O
policies O
according O
needs O
, O
is O
not O
always O
good O
lecture O
where B-INCORRECT
it O
may O
create O
some O
conflicts O
between O
. O

An O
example O
of O
that B-INCORRECT
is O
the O
marriage O
homosexual B-INCORRECT
where B-INCORRECT
some O
state B-INCORRECT
admit B-INCORRECT
this O
, O
others O
do O
n't O
. O

Also O
, O
the B-INCORRECT
reading O
passage O
declares O
that O
even O
federal O
government O
let B-INCORRECT
each O
state O
function O
independently O
it O
still O
control B-INCORRECT
on B-INCORRECT
main O
decisions O
. O

this B-INCORRECT
case B-INCORRECT
causes O
some O
problems O
where O
the O
lecturer O
mentioned O
failure O
of O
federal O
government O
to O
stop O
illegal O
immigration O
USA B-INCORRECT
through O
Nevada B-INCORRECT
desert O
. O

also B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
control O
of B-INCORRECT
federal O
government O
is O
reason O
why O
each O
state B-INCORRECT
and O
blame B-INCORRECT
other O
in B-INCORRECT
increase O
unemployment O
some O
states O

In O
conclusion O
, O
federal O
government O
which B-INCORRECT
give B-INCORRECT
freedom O
and O
powerful B-INCORRECT
cause B-INCORRECT
many O
problems O
such B-INCORRECT
as O
no O
single O
policy O
confusion O
in B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
responsibility O
. O

Travelling O
to O
a O
different O
country O
can O
be O
both O
exciting O
and O
frustrating O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O

I O
think O
that O
any O
type O
of O
trip O
is O
exciting O
but B-INCORRECT
also B-INCORRECT
have O
their O
frustrating O
moments O
. O

In O
order O
to B-INCORRECT
enjoy O
travelling O
Mexico O
I B-INCORRECT
would O
give O
two O
important O
advice B-INCORRECT
; O
first O
try B-INCORRECT
get O
alone B-INCORRECT
with O
travel B-INCORRECT
companion O
and O
Mexican B-INCORRECT
food O
instead O
critic B-INCORRECT
about B-INCORRECT
spicy B-INCORRECT
savor B-INCORRECT
. O

People O
say O
that O
in B-INCORRECT
every O
voyage B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
people O
suffer O
to B-INCORRECT
different O
moments O
of O
trip B-INCORRECT
: O
arrived B-INCORRECT
, O
get O
away O
frustration O
an O
unknown O
place O
alone B-INCORRECT
with O
your O
companion O
success B-INCORRECT
as O
a O
traveler O
and O
home O
triumphal B-INCORRECT
. O

In O
order O
to O
enjoy O
a O
trip O
Mexico O
I B-INCORRECT
suggest O
that O
the O
traveler O
find B-INCORRECT
manner B-INCORRECT
get O
alone B-INCORRECT
with O
his O
or O
her O
companion O
. O

This O
minimal O
chance O
would B-INCORRECT
make O
a O
big O
difference O
when O
you O
visit O
other B-INCORRECT
city O
. O

As O
an O
example O
, O
if O
you O
are O
able O
to O
get O
alone B-INCORRECT
with B-INCORRECT
your O
travel O
companion O
could B-INCORRECT
enjoy O
each O
moment O
of O
the O
trip O
exchange O
some O
pictures O
eat O
together O
and O
visit O
places O
common O
interest O
such O
as O
museums O
or O
malls O
. O

Other O
advice O
that O
I O
would O
give O
to O
people O
coming O
Mexico O
is O
enjoy B-INCORRECT
for B-INCORRECT
Mexican O
food O
. O

Mexican O
food O
has O
a O
lot O
of B-INCORRECT
tasting B-INCORRECT
dishes O
from O
different O
states O
the O
country O
. O

For O
example O
, O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
American O
people O
that O
does B-INCORRECT
n't O
like O
spicy O
food O
and B-INCORRECT
also O
most B-INCORRECT
the O
times B-INCORRECT
could B-INCORRECT
get O
angry O
with B-INCORRECT
excess B-INCORRECT
pepper O
Mexican O
used B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
use O
prepare O
their O
. O

As O
advice B-INCORRECT
I B-INCORRECT
would O
suggest O
you O
to B-INCORRECT
ask O
for O
sauces O
with O
lower B-INCORRECT
pepper O
. O

In O
this O
way O
the B-INCORRECT
visitors O
would B-INCORRECT
be O
able O
to O
enjoy O
Mexican O
food O
with O
less O
pepper O
and O
same O
delicious O
savor B-INCORRECT
that O
is O
so O
characteristic O
of O
our O
country O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
offered B-INCORRECT
two O
important O
advice B-INCORRECT
for O
visitors O
that O
coming B-INCORRECT
to O
my O
country O
: O
Try B-INCORRECT
get O
alone B-INCORRECT
with O
their B-INCORRECT
companion O
in O
order O
have O
fun O
and B-INCORRECT
try O
enjoy O
Mexican O
food O
because B-INCORRECT
it O
is O
delicious O
! O

After O
the O
Internet O
was O
invented O
and O
revealed O
first B-INCORRECT
time O
in O
August O
29th O
1969 O
, O
Social O
Media O
Site O
( O
SMS O
) O
is O
next O
most O
significant O
innovation O
that O
has O
partly O
replaced O
for B-INCORRECT
face O
to B-INCORRECT
communication O
. O

SMS O
such B-INCORRECT
as O
Facebook O
send B-INCORRECT
out O
700.000 B-INCORRECT
messages O
, O
and O
170.000 B-INCORRECT
Tweets O
are O
publicized B-INCORRECT
on O
Twitter O
each B-INCORRECT
60 O
seconds O
. O

Unsurprisingly O
, O
social B-INCORRECT
consequences O
of O
Facebook O
and O
Twitter O
plays B-INCORRECT
an O
important O
role O
in O
communication O
regardless O
distance O
or O
time O
. O

However O
, O
people O
who O
use O
Facebook O
Twitter O
or O
SMS O
in O
general O
are O
not O
likely O
to O
have O
their O
own O
personal O
privacy O
that B-INCORRECT
there O
is O
a O
possibility O
of O
cycle B-INCORRECT
bullying O
. O

This O
essay O
will O
force B-INCORRECT
on O
benefits B-INCORRECT
and O
disadvantages O
of O
Facebook O
Twitter O
, O
also O
comments B-INCORRECT
potential B-INCORRECT
future O
these O
implications O
. O

Communicating O
can O
be O
achieved O
, O
regardless O
of O
distance O
through O
Facebook O
and O
Twitter O
. O

The O
benefit O
of O
being B-INCORRECT
from B-INCORRECT
connected O
globally O
to B-INCORRECT
Facebook O
and O
Twitter O
is O
that O
messages O
can O
be O
transmitted O
almost B-INCORRECT
instantly B-INCORRECT
viewers B-INCORRECT
. O

Firstly O
, O
Facebook O
and O
Twitter O
can O
be O
used O
when O
their O
users O
are O
in B-INCORRECT
an O
unpleasant O
mood O
where O
negative O
feelings O
expressed O
. O

Secondly O
, O
Facebook O
provides O
the O
opportunity O
to O
remain O
in O
touch O
with O
daily B-INCORRECT
activities O
from B-INCORRECT
friends O
making O
observations O
of B-INCORRECT
relationships O
maintaining O
one O

That O
is O
to O
say O
, O
human O
behaviour O
on O
Facebook O
are O
interacted O
we B-INCORRECT
with O
others O
by O
sharing O
their O
mood O
and O
receiving O
responses O
. O

Thirdly O
, O
Facebook O
can O
be O
used O
as O
an O
organizational O
communication O
tool O
in O
business O
. O

Knowledge O
about O
the O
members O
increases O
continually O
, O
and O
moreover O
maintaining O
relations O
with O
other O
existing O
also O
sharing O

interests O
by B-INCORRECT
social O

Finally O
, O
people O
are O
allowed O
to O
follow O
anyone O
who O
they O
find O
enjoyable O
through O
Twitter O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
by O
following O
famous O

people O
can O
easily O
see O
every B-INCORRECT

However O
, O
due O
to O
this O

also O
there B-INCORRECT
is O
a O
high O
potential O
of O
purposely B-INCORRECT
aggressive O
toward O
someone O
. O

However O
, O
information O
which O
is B-INCORRECT
appeared B-INCORRECT
on O
Facebook O

are B-INCORRECT
easily O
accessible O
therefore B-INCORRECT
everybody O
can O
response B-INCORRECT

However B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
information B-INCORRECT
which B-INCORRECT
is B-INCORRECT
appeared B-INCORRECT
on B-INCORRECT
Facebook B-INCORRECT
or B-INCORRECT

everybody B-INCORRECT
can B-INCORRECT
response B-INCORRECT
as B-INCORRECT
a B-INCORRECT
public B-INCORRECT
opinion B-INCORRECT
. B-INCORRECT

Mostly O
Facebook B-INCORRECT
users O
expect O
their O
friend B-INCORRECT
to O
respond O
or O
pay O
attention O
on B-INCORRECT
what O
they O
are O
doing O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
along O
with O
agreeable O
and O
pleasant O
comments O
there O
are O
also O
small O
amounts O
of O
aggressive O
even O
racist O
comment B-INCORRECT
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
people O
can O
post O
any O
racist O
comments O
which O
target O
a O
specific O
group O
or O
person O
. O

For O
example O
, O
after O
the O
premier O
of O
The O
Hunger O
Game O
was O
released O
a O
fan O
posted O
an O
onset O
racist O
tweet O
that B-INCORRECT
saying O
they O
were O
unhappy O
because O
one O
main O
actresses O
performed B-INCORRECT
by B-INCORRECT
Black B-INCORRECT
person O
( O
Rauch O
and O
Schanz O
2013 O
) O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
accessible O
information O
through O
SMS O
, O
it O
has O
led O
to O
many O
problems O
involve B-INCORRECT
with O
cycle O
- O
bullying O
badgering O
stalking O
behaviour O
( O
Krishna O
as O
cited O
in O
Williams O
& O
Merten O
2008 O
) O
. O

For O
example O
, O
Krishna O
et O
al.(2013 O
) O
reports O
a B-INCORRECT
case O
of O
continuous O
disturbing B-INCORRECT
woman O
from B-INCORRECT
man O
called O
Mr O

X O
" O
admitted O
to O
a O
state O
psychiatric O

after O
being O

not O

Potentially O
, O
Facebook O
and O
Twitter O
SMS O
in O
general O
may O
replace O
face O
to B-INCORRECT
communication O
improve O
their O
functions O
because O
people O
feel O
more O
freedom O
or O
enjoy O
using O
without O
have B-INCORRECT
view B-INCORRECT
each O
other O
appearances B-INCORRECT
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
would O
be O
easier O
to O
connected O
and O
keep O
in O
touch O
with O
friends O
within O
a O
second O
rather O
than O
have O
call O
them O
. O

The O
possibly B-INCORRECT
outcomes O
might O
be O
the B-INCORRECT
more O
time O
people O
spend O
on O
SMS O
, O
less B-INCORRECT
communicate B-INCORRECT
skills O
that B-INCORRECT
they O
have O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
to B-INCORRECT
decrease O
the O
risk O
of O
negative O
comments O
or O
posts O
Facebook O
and O
Twitter O
would B-INCORRECT
improve O
their O
futures O
solve B-INCORRECT
less B-INCORRECT
personal O
privacy O
problem O
. O

For O
example O
, O
controlling O
what O
posts O
should O
be O
sent O
by O
adding O
more O
privacy O
options O
. O

However O
, O
despite O
the O
useful B-INCORRECT
of O
these O
implications O
people O
should O
pay O
attention O
that B-INCORRECT
Facebook O
and O
Twitter O
could O
affect O
their O
social O
life O
by B-INCORRECT
avoid O
using O
it O
most O
time O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
the O
benefits O
from B-INCORRECT
using O
Facebook O
and O
Twitter O
is B-INCORRECT
that O
people O
can O
communicate O
being B-INCORRECT
connected O
to O
their O
friends O
frequently O
. O

Also O
people B-INCORRECT
can O
easily O
reduce O
their O
negative O
mood O
by O
sharing O
and O
expressing O
how O
they O
feel O
. O

In O
contrast O
, O
because O
Facebook O
and O
Twitter O
have O
been O
connected O
worldwide O
which B-INCORRECT
means B-INCORRECT
protecting O
personal O
privacy O
is O
probably O
impossible O
. O

Possibly O
, O
users O
might O
express O
aggressive B-INCORRECT
toward B-INCORRECT
each O
other O
because O
of O
lack O
privacy O
. O

Photography O
classes O
for O
everyone O

Introduction O

Teenagers O
are O
constantly O
influenced O
by O
social O
networks O
like O
Facebook O
, O
Instagram O
Pinterest O
etc O
. O

Photographs O
are O
included O
in B-INCORRECT
all O
of O
those O
sites O
. O

Also O
, O
this O
phenomenon O
of O
taking O
photographs O
is O
part O
our O
daily O
life O
because O
it O
the O
best O
way O
to O
capture O
special O
moments O
like O
birthdays O
travels B-INCORRECT
ocassions B-INCORRECT
etc O
. O

As O
a O
new O
college O
subject O

This O
practice O
is O
considered O
those B-INCORRECT
activities O
that O
anyone O
can O
do O
without O
any O
kind O
of O
special O
preparation O
. O

However O
, O
teaching O
students O
how O
to O
apply O
better O
techniques O
in B-INCORRECT
the O
moment O
of O
taking O
a O
picture O
should O
be O
consider B-INCORRECT
as B-INCORRECT
learning O
draw O
. O

Both O
skills O
are B-INCORRECT
required O
in O
today O
's O
world O
and O
necessary B-INCORRECT
to O
be O
developed O
the O
education O
system O
at B-INCORRECT
same O
level O
. O

The O
reasons O

Recent O
studies O
show O
that O
in O
the O
last O
twenty O
years O
more O
than O
3,000 O
photographs O
are B-INCORRECT
taken O
per O
person O
world O
, O
especially O
latest O
generations B-INCORRECT
lifes(teenagers B-INCORRECT
and O
kids O
) O
. O

This O
increase O
is O
related O
with B-INCORRECT
the O
overwhelming O
development O
of O
technologies O
in O
computers O
, O
cameras O
cellphones O
etc O
. O

Also O
, O
photography O
is O
considered O
as O
a O
type O
of O
art O
so O
it O
requires O
the O
knowledge O
especial B-INCORRECT
skills O
techniques O
and O
. O

What O
a B-INCORRECT
lovely O
weather O
today O
! O

What O
a O
wonderful O
day O
! O
There B-INCORRECT
is O
an B-INCORRECT
April O
now O
and O
finally O
spring O
came B-INCORRECT
. O

A O
bright O
sun O
is O
shining O
, O
the O
snow O
melted O
away O
in O
March O
. O

The O
first O
spring O
birds O
came B-INCORRECT
back O
from O
the O
warm O
countries O
. O

They O
are O
singing O
funny O
and O
building O
their O
nests O
. O

People O
look O
happier O
. O

They O
are O
feeling O
tired O
after O
a O
long O
snowy O
winter O
. O

We O
set O
our O
clock B-INCORRECT
forward O
one O
hour O
in O
March O
. O

The O
summertime B-INCORRECT
was O
first O
introduced O
in O
England O
1908 O
. O

The O
days O
become O
longer O
and O
the O
nights O
get O
shorter O
lighter O
. O

We O
usually O
set O
our O
clock B-INCORRECT
back O
an O
hour O
in O
October O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
people O
are O
happy O
, O
because O
they O
can O
sleep O
( O
for O
) O
one O
hour O
more O
. O

Hockey O
as O
a O
life B-INCORRECT
style B-INCORRECT

Although O
all O
sports O
help O
you O
to O
have O
a O
healthy O
life O
, O
hockey O
provides O
more B-INCORRECT
than O
just O
being O
or O
fit O
. O

What O
are O
you O
thinking O
of O
whenever O
choose O
a O
sport O
? O

You O
think O
that O
your O
life B-INCORRECT
style B-INCORRECT
will O
improve O
? O

Well O
you O
are O
mistaken O
. O

For B-INCORRECT
doing B-INCORRECT
different O
kind B-INCORRECT
of O
sports O
you B-INCORRECT
need O
to O
be O
skilled O
or O
willing O
try O
new O
things O
. O

What O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
none B-INCORRECT
of O
those O
requierments B-INCORRECT
? O

Then O
you O
know O
hockey O
is O
the O
aswner B-INCORRECT
. O

hockey B-INCORRECT
is O
a O
sport O
I O
have O
played O
for O
many O
years O
and O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
my O
favorite O
. O

It O
's O
a O
good O
way O
of O
learning O
how O
to O
communicate O
and O
work O
with O
people O
. O
in B-INCORRECT
simple B-INCORRECT
words B-INCORRECT
, O

it O
's O
a O
team O
sport O
. O

However O
it B-INCORRECT
's O
not O
always O
as O
simple O
sounds O
. O

You O
have O
to O
train O
five O
days O
a O
week O
and O
you O
need O
concentrate O
lot O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
I B-INCORRECT
enjoy O
every O
second O
of O
it O
. O

Through O
all O
my O
life B-INCORRECT
I O
have O
been B-INCORRECT
willing B-INCORRECT
to O
improve O
in B-INCORRECT
this O
sport O
and O
since O
2010 O
it O
has O
became B-INCORRECT
a O
style B-INCORRECT
me O
. O

Why O
will B-INCORRECT
I O
recommend O
this O
to O
you O
? O

It O
would O
definitely O
help O
you O
to O
grow O
and O
improve O
as O
a O
person O
. O

Hockey O
will O
change O
the O
way O
you O
see O
world O
and O
are B-INCORRECT
going B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
start O
seen B-INCORRECT
it O
with O
other B-INCORRECT
eyes O
. O

So O
stop O
searching O
for O
the O
right O
sport O
, B-INCORRECT
this B-INCORRECT
one O
is O
you O
! O

As O
far O
as O
I O
'm O
concerned O
, O
public O
transportation O
is O
the O
best O
transport B-INCORRECT
media B-INCORRECT
for O
environmental B-INCORRECT
care B-INCORRECT
. O

In B-INCORRECT
spite B-INCORRECT
of B-INCORRECT
some O
people O
make O
enough O
money O
to O
buy O
their O
own O
car O
, O
electric O
and O
hybrid O
cars O
are O
more O
expensive O
than O
traditional O
ones O
( O
the O
who B-INCORRECT
use O
gas O
or O
diesel O
) O
so O
choose O
this B-INCORRECT
that O
's O
because B-INCORRECT
pollution O
is O
several B-INCORRECT
issue B-INCORRECT
we O
have O
deal O
with O
. O

The B-INCORRECT
environmental B-INCORRECT
care O
is O
taking B-INCORRECT
strength O
every O
day O
, O
from O
kids O
too B-INCORRECT
ancient B-INCORRECT
people O
. O

The O
government O
and O
many O
companies O
are O
measuring O
the B-INCORRECT
CO2 O
emissions O
which O
being O
produced O
by O
industrial O
or O
service O
processes O
that O
necessary O
for O
producing O
goods O
social B-INCORRECT
consume B-INCORRECT
. O

If O
people O
do B-INCORRECT
n't O
use O
public O
transportation O
, O
they O
could O
walk O
ride O
a O
bike O
or O
buy O
traditional O
car O
and O
that O
will O
probably O
take B-INCORRECT
place B-INCORRECT
when O
the O
destiny B-INCORRECT
is O
far O
from O
where O
you O
live O
. O

From O
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
public O
transportation O
will O
be O
very O
important O
in O
the O
future O
especially O
developed O
countries O
. O

I O
think O
the B-INCORRECT
government O
will B-INCORRECT
slow B-INCORRECT
down B-INCORRECT
fee B-INCORRECT
in B-INCORRECT
public O
transportation O
, B-INCORRECT
that B-INCORRECT
could O
make O
people O
to B-INCORRECT
use O
and O
caring B-INCORRECT
environment O
from O
CO2 O
emissions O
prevent O
global O
heating B-INCORRECT
. O

In O
Coslada O
City B-INCORRECT
Council B-INCORRECT
, O
people O
are O
well O
informed O
about O
taking O
care O
environment B-INCORRECT
. O

The O
city O
council O
has O
developed B-INCORRECT
several O
campaigns O
to O
improve O
the B-INCORRECT
awareness O
of O
its O
citizens O
, B-INCORRECT
for B-INCORRECT
example O
children O
learn O
at O
school O
how O
separate O
waste O
. O

There O
are O
many O
ecological O
islands O
. O

Each O
of O
them O
has O
three O
or O
four O
kinds O
bins O
and O
they O
are O
not O
as O
far O
two O
hundred O
meters O
. O

There O
have O
been O
several O
planting O
campaigns O
to O
plant O
trees O
and O
clean O
the O
river O
Jarama O
side B-INCORRECT
. O

Nevertheness B-INCORRECT
it B-INCORRECT
is O
never O
enough O
, O
because O
dog O
's B-INCORRECT
owners O
that B-INCORRECT
they B-INCORRECT
have B-INCORRECT
most B-INCORRECT
of B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
blame O
. O

Since O
2008 O
, O
there O
are O
many O
bike O
paths O
across O
the B-INCORRECT
city O
so O
citizens O
will O
be O
able O
to O
avoid O
car O
and O
they O
emit B-INCORRECT
less O
air O
pollution O
. O

The O
organic O
waste O
is O
picked O
up O
every O
day O
and O
plastic O
paper O
other O
. O

The O
most O
important O
thing O
in O
the B-INCORRECT
environment B-INCORRECT
care B-INCORRECT
is O
education O
of O
children O
. O

Our O
planet O
is O
in O
such O
a O
difficult O
situation O
that O
we O
have O
to O
take O
over O
the O
problem O
. O

A O
problem O
which O
was O
caused O
by O
us O
, O
human O
beings O
with O
their O
target O
of O
making O
money O
without O
thinking O
the O
effects O
. O

My O
family O
is O
very O
conscious O
of O
this O
trouble B-INCORRECT
so O
we O
make O
any O
effort O
to O
solve O
it O
. O

We O
usually O
use O
the B-INCORRECT
public O
transport O
, O
which O
has B-INCORRECT
a B-INCORRECT
great O
quality O
in O
city O
I B-INCORRECT
live O
. O

It O
works O
perfectly O
: O
it O
is O
always O
on O
time O
and O
the O
price O
worth B-INCORRECT
. O

We O
live O
in O
a O
cottage O
and O
we O
have O
several O
bins O
which O
are O
clasified B-INCORRECT
according O
to O
the O
material O
want O
recycle O
. O

Moreover O
, O
we O
run O
an O
organization O
which O
pays O
people O
who O
bring O
us O
the O
materials O
to O
recycle O
. O

The O
benefits B-INCORRECT
are O
given O
to O
several O
organizations O
which O
take O
of B-INCORRECT
care O
the O
environment O
. O

My O
sister O
teaches O
people O
what O
to O
do O
with O
things O
they O
want O
rid B-INCORRECT
of O
, O
such O
as O
bottles O
or O
papers B-INCORRECT
. O

She O
is O
able O
to O
do B-INCORRECT
such O
beautiful O
jewellery O
that O
lots O
of O
people O
are O
following O
her O
! O

It O
shows O
that O
this O
kind O
of O
things B-INCORRECT
can O
have O
a O
second O
life O
. O

As O
soon O
as O
the B-INCORRECT
last O
river O
ends O
southern O
border O
of O
Egypt O
is O
here O
. O

The O
Nile O
river O
is O
the O
origin O
of O
ancient O
Egyptian O
civilization O
that B-INCORRECT
counts B-INCORRECT
over O
6 O
thousand O
years O
. B-INCORRECT

All O
historians O
, O
researchers O
scientists O
agree O
with B-INCORRECT
this O
. O

And O
as O
for O
me O
, O
I O
totally O
support O
their O
point O
of O
view O
. O

Egypt O
is O
a O
kind O
of O
the B-INCORRECT
river O
civilization O
among B-INCORRECT
huge O
desert B-INCORRECT
Sahara B-INCORRECT
. O

All B-INCORRECT
over B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
time O
Nile O
is B-INCORRECT
only O
source O
of O
water O
for O
Egyptians O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
elevation B-INCORRECT
of B-INCORRECT
the O
water O
level O
on O
river O
helps O
people O
to O
realize O
possibility O
expanding O
area O
fertile O
lands O
. O

The O
Egyptians O
called O
their O
country O
' O
Black O
Land O
to O
mark O
it O
off O
of B-INCORRECT
the O
red O
soil O
desert B-INCORRECT
. O

Nowadays O
, O
deep B-INCORRECT
and O
wide O
valley O
of O
the O
Nile O
became B-INCORRECT
most O
important O
transport O
line O
for O
Egypt O
. O

Through O
the O
centuries O
people B-INCORRECT
have O
been O
exploring O
nature O
of O
Nile O
. O

The O
ancient O
Egyptians O
divided O
the O
year O
for B-INCORRECT
three O
seasons O
compared O
to O
dry O
or O
wet O
period O
. O

They O
knew O
when O
it O
will B-INCORRECT
be O
the O
' O
Green O
Nile O
or O
Red O
to O
stock O
up O
with O
clean O
water O
. O

But O
such O
high B-INCORRECT
level O
of O
development O
Egyptian O
civilization O
has O
the B-INCORRECT
negative O
side O
as O
well O
positive B-INCORRECT
. O

The B-INCORRECT
great O
amount B-INCORRECT
of O
dams O
were O
built O
on O
the O
river O
that O
caused O
disappearing B-INCORRECT
a O
lot O
plants O
and O
animals O
. O

Anyway O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
Egyptians O
still O
living B-INCORRECT
far O
from O
the B-INCORRECT
main O
water O
artery O
country O
and O
hardly B-INCORRECT
can B-INCORRECT
find O
clean O
to O
drink O
. O

But O
I O
hope O
, O
as O
soon O
Egypt O
become B-INCORRECT
developing B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
government O
will O
pay O
attention O
to O
ecological O
problems O
that O
high O
level O
. O

When O
most O
people O
think O
about O
an O
important O
historical O
place O
in O
Italy O
, O
they O
of O
Duomo O
Milano O
. O

But O
the O
Duomo O
is O
not O
most O
important O
. O

I O
am O
sure O
you O
'll O
agree O
that O
it O
's O
the O
Colosseum O
. O

For O
centuries O
this B-INCORRECT
building O
had B-INCORRECT
been O
the O
symbol O
of O
city O
. O

It O
quite B-INCORRECT
ancient O
, O
but O
still O
fascinating O
for O
thousand B-INCORRECT
of O
tourists O
who O
come O
every O
year O
. O

It O
was O
built O
in O
79 O
A.C. B-INCORRECT
by O
Tito O
, O
who O
the O
Roman O
emperor O
. O

It O
was O
used O
for O
shows O
with O
animals O
or O
humans O
, O
who O
were O
killed O
without O
pity O
. O

Moreover B-INCORRECT
navy B-INCORRECT
wars O
were O
represented O
in O
order O
to O
celebrate O
Roman B-INCORRECT
army O
. O

It O
is B-INCORRECT
ruined O
through O
the O
ages O
, O
but O
now O
people O
understand O
his B-INCORRECT
importance O
and O
take O
care O
of O
it O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
it B-INCORRECT
is O
important O
because O
remembers B-INCORRECT
our O
past O
and O
traditions O
, O
which O
we O
should O
n't O
forget O
. O

However O
not B-INCORRECT
all O
people O
are O
aware O
of O
it O
. O

It O
's O
our O
strength O
and O
every O
time O
I O
go O
beyond O
realize O
how O
many O
people O
succeeded O
in O
building O
it O
. O

That O
's O
why O
it O
is O
important O
: O
makes O
us O
understand O
to B-INCORRECT
never O
give O
up O
and O
follow B-INCORRECT
our O
dreams O
. O

In O
this O
fast O
moving O
world O
transport B-INCORRECT
has O
become O
an O
important O
factor O
for O
everyday O
activities O
. O

Everybody O
needs O
a O
mode O
of O
transport O
to O
earn O
their O
daily B-INCORRECT
living O
. O

There O
is O
no O
point O
in O
saying O
public O
transport O
has O
future O
. O

Travelling O
through B-INCORRECT
car O
is O
a O
convenient O
mode O
of O
transport O
, O
but O
most O
the O
population O
can O
not O
afford O
it O
. O

There O
are O
advantages O
and O
disadvantages O
in B-INCORRECT
using O
a B-INCORRECT
public O
transport O
. O

Firstly O
to B-INCORRECT
discuss O
the O
benefits O
of O
public O
transport O
it B-INCORRECT
is O
cheap O
and O
affordable O
for O
all O
class B-INCORRECT
people O
in O
society O
. O

Variety B-INCORRECT
of O
buses O
are O
released B-INCORRECT
by O
the O
government O
in O
order O
to O
meet O
people O
's O
financial O
conditions B-INCORRECT
. O

Using O
public O
transport O
is O
a O
time B-INCORRECT
waste B-INCORRECT
and O
no B-INCORRECT
privacy O
are O
some O
of O
the O
disadvantages O
. O

Similarly O
travelling B-INCORRECT
by O
car O
has O
its O
own O
advantage B-INCORRECT
and O
disadvantages O
. O

Everybody B-INCORRECT
can B-INCORRECT
not B-INCORRECT
afford O
a O
travel B-INCORRECT
through B-INCORRECT
car O
as O
it O
is B-INCORRECT
costly O
, O
but O
to O
discuss O
the O
benefits O
one O
enjoy O
high B-INCORRECT
privacy B-INCORRECT
during B-INCORRECT
and O
convenient O

and O
sophisticated O
can B-INCORRECT
travel O
faster O
. O

To O
sum O
up O
with B-INCORRECT
it O
is O
not O
appropriate O
to O
say O
that O
there O
no O
future O
for O
public O
transport O
because O
both O
has B-INCORRECT
equal O
advantage B-INCORRECT
and O
disadvantages O
. O

Sometime B-INCORRECT
I O
think O
that O
Taipei O
is O
too O
crowded O
. O

There O
is O
no O
denying O
that O
the O
MRT O
in O
this O
city O
such O
a O
convenient O
metropolitan O
system O
. O

However O
, O
during O
the O
rush O
hour O
there O
are O
always O
have B-INCORRECT
such O
a O
ruin O
person B-INCORRECT
who O
has B-INCORRECT
no O
public O
awareness O
at O
all O
. O

They O
occupy O
too O
many O
seats O
, O
inclouding B-INCORRECT
priority O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
most O
of O
them O
are O
students O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
respect O
other O
passengers O
, O
just B-INCORRECT
keep O
laughing O
and O
teasing O
each O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
some O
people O
have O
told O
them O
not O
to O
this O
. O

Moreover O
, O
I O
think O
that O
provide B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
seat B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
elders B-INCORRECT
is O
also O
a O
problem O
. O

Priority O
seats O
, B-INCORRECT
are O
preserved B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
those O
who O
need O
not O
only O
elders B-INCORRECT
but O
also O
some O
adult B-INCORRECT
it B-INCORRECT
. O

Somehow O
, O
not B-INCORRECT
all B-INCORRECT
of B-INCORRECT
them B-INCORRECT
can B-INCORRECT
you B-INCORRECT
identify O
whether O
their O
bodies O
feel O
uncomfortable O
merely O
from O
appearance O
which O
lead B-INCORRECT
to O
Some B-INCORRECT
misunderstanding O
between O
. O

Some O
people O
even O
blame B-INCORRECT
them O
for O
they B-INCORRECT
occupy B-INCORRECT
the O
seats O
instead O
of O
offer B-INCORRECT
seat B-INCORRECT
. O

Moreover O
, O
some O
old O
people O
would B-INCORRECT
take O
this O
considerative B-INCORRECT
action O
for O
granted O
and O
they O
even O
command O
young O
adults O
or O
students O
offer B-INCORRECT
their O
seat O
without O
manners O
! O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
the O
transportation O
in O
our O
city O
have B-INCORRECT
nothing O
to O
criticize O
expect O
that O
. O

Everyone O
should O
develop O
the B-INCORRECT
awareness O
of O
public O
manner B-INCORRECT
. O

Television O
is O
an O
important O
part O
of O
modern O
culture O
. O

We O
depend O
on O
television O
for O
entertainment O
, O
education O
news O
and O
films O

TV O
has O
much B-INCORRECT
benefits O
: O

Firstly O
it B-INCORRECT
enables O
young O
people O
to O
share O
cultural O
experiences O
with O
others O
. O

TV O
can O
act O
as O
a O
catalyst O
to O
get O
kids O
reading O
- O
following O
up O
on O
programs O
by O
getting O
books O
the O
same O
subjects O
or O
authors O
whose O
work O
was O
adapted O
for O
. O

Television O
can O
teach O
kids O
important O
values O
and O
life O
lessons O
. O

Educational O
programming O
can O
develop O
young O
children O
's O
socialization O
and O
learning O
skills O
. O

News O
, O
current O
events O
and O
historical O
programming O
can O
help O
make O
young O
people O
more O
aware O
of O
other O
cultures O
. O

Documentaries O
can O
help O
develop O
critical O
thinking O
about O
society O
and O
the O
world O
. O

TV O
can O
help O
introduce O
youth B-INCORRECT
to O
classic O
Hollywood O
films O
and O
foreign O
movies O
that O
they O
might O
not O
otherwise O
see O
. O

Cultural O
programming O
can O
open O
up O
the O
world O
of O
music O
and O
art O
for O
young O
people O
. O

But O
television O
have B-INCORRECT
also B-INCORRECT
negative O
effects O
: O
First O
of O
all O
, O
children O
who O
spend O
a O
great O
deal O
time O
watching O
get O
less O
exercise O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
these O
children O
receive O
less O
socialization O
with O
other O
. O

Television O
also O
takes O
away O
from O
family O
time O
. O

This O
is O
also O
true O
for O
families O
who O
eat O
in O
front O
of O
the O
television O
. O

I O
deal O
with O
consulting O
and O

in O

I O

I O

In O

non B-INCORRECT

and B-INCORRECT

. B-INCORRECT

I O
have O
faced O
several O
situations O
always B-INCORRECT
work O
with O
serenity O
and O
enthusiasm O
, B-INCORRECT
like O
to O
in O
a O
multicultural O
dynamic O
. B-INCORRECT

I O
'm O
careful O
to O
meet O
the O
goals O
of O
team O
in O
which O
work O
, O
cooperating O
with O
colleagues O
achieve O
by O
providing O

skills O
always O
willing B-INCORRECT
learn O
respecting O
other O
points O

together B-INCORRECT
finding O
ways O
deal O
. O

I O
work B-INCORRECT
for O
the O
same O
large O
company O
25 O
years O
, O
now B-INCORRECT
is O
time O
to O
change O
and O
find O
new O
job O
opportunities O
. O

Needs B-INCORRECT
to O
work O
my B-INCORRECT
husband O
has O
been O
living O
in O
Zaandam O
, B-INCORRECT
I O
want O
find O
a O
new O
job O
Holland O
rejoin B-INCORRECT
our O
family O
. O

I O
like O
sports O
such O
as O
skiing O
, B-INCORRECT
riding O
and O
swimming O
. O
've O
also O
got O
the B-INCORRECT
rescue O
licence O
worked O
a O
lifeguard O
in O
summer O
studying B-INCORRECT
for O
patent O
padi O
dive O
master O

Nowadays O
we O
all O
hope O
, B-INCORRECT
that O
public O
transport O
can O
save O
the O
world O
. O

When O
we O
see O
all O
this B-INCORRECT
cars O
in O
our O
yards O
, O
when O
stay B-INCORRECT
traffic O
jam B-INCORRECT
think O
that O
one O
day O
will O
have O
to O
live B-INCORRECT
car O
and O
use O
public O
transport O
. O

If O
we O
do O
n't O
it O
, O
one O
day O
'll O
wake O
up O
in O
the B-INCORRECT
immortal B-INCORRECT
traffic O
jam O
. O

But O
, O
probably O
this O
situation O
is O
only O
period B-INCORRECT
of O
development O
transport O
. O

We O
are O
told O
about O
a O
lot O
of O
innovations O
in O
this O
spheare B-INCORRECT
. O

For O
instance O
, O
Google O
reported O
about O
Googlemobile O
. O

Maybe O
, B-INCORRECT
robots O
will O
be O
able O
to O
drive O
more O
smart B-INCORRECT
then B-INCORRECT
people O
. O

If O
they O
will B-INCORRECT
contact O
each O
other O
and O
use O
Googlemap O
or O
something O
like O
that O
, O
be O
able O
to O
avoid O
accidents O
on O
the O
roads O
. O

So O
people O
will O
be O
able O
to O
avoid O
traffic O
jams O
. O

Not O
all O
people O
like O
the O
idea O
of O
Googlemobile O
. O

Some O
people O
think O
, B-INCORRECT
it O
might O
take O
away O
their O
independence O
. O

But O
another B-INCORRECT
of B-INCORRECT
people O
think O
that O
it O
is O
not O
so O
bad O
idea B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
because O
they O
will O
be O
able O
to O
drink O
in O
spite O
the O
fact O
are O
drivers O
at O
moment O
. O

However O
, O
there O
will O
always O
be B-INCORRECT
people O
who O
dislike O
to B-INCORRECT
a O
driver O
anyway O
. O

And O
people B-INCORRECT
who B-INCORRECT
hate B-INCORRECT
public B-INCORRECT
transport B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
there B-INCORRECT
will B-INCORRECT
always B-INCORRECT
be B-INCORRECT
. O

The O
question O
is O
, O
which O
sort O
of O
people O
have O
more O
impact O
in O
the O
world O
and O
finally O
who O
will O
decide O
. B-INCORRECT

How O
many O
language B-INCORRECT
do O
you O
speak O
? O

Did O
you O
ever O
think O
of O
learning O
another O
foreign O
language O
? O

Or O
do O
you O
want O
to O
be O
a O
polyglot O
? O

Today O
it O
is O
miles O
time B-INCORRECT
important O
to O
learn O
a O
foreign O
language O
than O
before O
. O

there B-INCORRECT
are O
few B-INCORRECT
reasons O
whcih B-INCORRECT
show O
you O
why O
it O
is O
important O
to O
learn O
a O
foreign O
language O
today O
. O

First O
, O
if O
you O
are O
planning O
to O
travel O
another O
country O
it O
is O
absolutely B-INCORRECT
useful O
speak O
local B-INCORRECT
language O
makes O
your O
trip O
more B-INCORRECT
easy B-INCORRECT
and O
comfortable B-INCORRECT
. O

Second O
, B-INCORRECT
for O
finding O
a O
good O
job O
opportunity O
the O
business O
exchange O
is O
increasing O
in B-INCORRECT
intrenational B-INCORRECT
level O
if B-INCORRECT
you O
speak O
foreign O
language O
certainly O
it O
adds O
some O
value O
on B-INCORRECT
your O
profile O
and O
can O
get O
higher O
salary O
. O

Third O
, B-INCORRECT
through O
learning O
a O
foreign O
language O
you O
do O
n't O
only O
learn O
at O
the O
time B-INCORRECT
are O
also O
getting O
know B-INCORRECT
its O
culture O
get B-INCORRECT
to O
different O
and O
society O
than O
yours O
's B-INCORRECT
it B-INCORRECT
enriches O
your O
knowledge O
. O

Over O
these O
years O
, O
there O
are O
more O
and O
miserable B-INCORRECT
accidents B-INCORRECT
happened B-INCORRECT
around O
the O
world O
. O

From O
newspapers O
, O
magazines O
even O
foreign O
medium B-INCORRECT
we O
can O
easily O
figure O
out O
that O
our O
environment O
is O
changing O
severely O
. O

Many O
scientists O
infer O
that O
people O
's O
lives O
will O
change O
dramatically O
in O
the O
next O
50 O
years O
because O
of O
humans O
' O
greedy B-INCORRECT
. O

Humans O
always O
desire O
to O
have O
a O
more O
convenient O
and O
comfortable O
life O
, O
but O
forget O
protect O
cherish O
the O
Earth O
at O
same O
time O
. O

High B-INCORRECT
- B-INCORRECT
technological B-INCORRECT
countries O
have O
developed B-INCORRECT
a O
great O
number O
of O
forests O
and O
lands B-INCORRECT
to O
build O
high B-INCORRECT
buildings O
. O

Various O
factories O
emit O
excessive O
carbon O
dioxide O
into O
the O
air O
. O

All O
the O
examples O
above O
will O
enhance B-INCORRECT
temperature O
and O
make O
Earth O
hotter O
. O

The O
higher O
temperature B-INCORRECT
enhance B-INCORRECT
, O
the O
worst B-INCORRECT
living B-INCORRECT
quality B-INCORRECT
is O
. O

If O
people O
around O
the O
world O
could B-INCORRECT
n't O
put O
more O
emphasis O
on O
our O
living B-INCORRECT
places B-INCORRECT
, O
we O
must B-INCORRECT
have O
a O
dark O
and O
hopeless O
future O
. O

Due O
to O
the B-INCORRECT
climate O
change O
, O
weather O
is O
so O
hot O
that O
people O
could O
even O
have O
a O
water O
shortage O
. O

Losing B-INCORRECT
enough O
water O
supply B-INCORRECT
, O
people O
's O
body B-INCORRECT
will O
become O
weak O
and O
rough O
. O

In O
this O
living B-INCORRECT
situation O
, O
instead O
of O
laughter O
and O
happiness O
there O
will O
be O
more O
fight B-INCORRECT
hatred O
sadness O
. O

Everyone O
lives B-INCORRECT
in O
despair O
, O
but O
can B-INCORRECT
not B-INCORRECT
find O
the O
entrance O
to O
brightness O
. O

The B-INCORRECT
terrible O
consequences O
, B-INCORRECT
are O
caused O
by O
the O
humans O
' O
unsatisfied O
heart B-INCORRECT
. O

Friends O
, O
from O
now O
let O
us O
be O
the O
members B-INCORRECT
to O
protect O
and O
take O
care O
of O
our O
Earth O
! O

It O
was O
dangerous O
, O
but O
I O
knew O
had O
to O
do O
it O
. O

The B-INCORRECT
undercovered B-INCORRECT
work O
is O
very O
hard O
, O
not O
just O
because O
you O
will O
with O
dangerous O
people O
the O
really B-INCORRECT
danger O
if O
get O
discovered O
. O

When O
people O
know B-INCORRECT
that O
they B-INCORRECT
were B-INCORRECT
deceived O
, O
trust O
broken B-INCORRECT
heads O
will O
roll O
. O

You O
have O
to O
be O
precise O
, O
fast O
and O
a O
really O
good O
actor O
. O

The O
passion O
for O
the O
cause O
is O
key O
to O
survive B-INCORRECT
. O

It O
is O
just O
something O
that O
I O
had O
to O
do O
, O
not O
you O
her O
me O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
choose O
that O
, B-INCORRECT
this B-INCORRECT
job O
has B-INCORRECT
chosen B-INCORRECT
me O

Dear O
Sir O

I O
would O

In O
our O
modern O
world O
, O
many O
people O
are O
suffered B-INCORRECT
from O
stress O
that O
spring B-INCORRECT
life O
conditions O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
this O
, O
people O
are O
working O
in B-INCORRECT
very O
stressful O
workplaces O
and O
they O
want O
leave O
from B-INCORRECT
condition O
holidays O
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
can O
be O
said O
that O
holidays O
are O
the B-INCORRECT
best O
option O
to B-INCORRECT
renew B-INCORRECT
soul B-INCORRECT
and B-INCORRECT
revive B-INCORRECT
spirit B-INCORRECT
for B-INCORRECT
people B-INCORRECT
. O

In B-INCORRECT
holidays O
, O
people O
can O
away B-INCORRECT
from O
daily O
problems O
and O
also O
take B-INCORRECT
more O
time O
with O
their O
friends O
family O
. O

In O
this O
respect O
, O
many O
people O
prefer O
to O
go O
natural B-INCORRECT
places O
with O
their O
families O
in O
order O
forget O
about O
bad O
situations O
on B-INCORRECT
lives O
. O

For O
example O
, O
walking O
in B-INCORRECT
the O
seaside O
or O
swimming O
sea O
can O
be O
helpful O
to O
forget O
hard O
life O
conditions O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
holidays O
are O
best O
for O
people O
in O
terms O
of O
thinking O
clearly O
their B-INCORRECT
experinces B-INCORRECT
about B-INCORRECT
life O
. O

People O
can O
review O
their O
decisions O
in B-INCORRECT
holidays O
more O
accurate B-INCORRECT
and O
helpful B-INCORRECT
. O

For O
instance O
, O
in O
stressful O
life O
conditions O
people O
can O
make O
bad O
decisions O
for B-INCORRECT
their O
future O
. O

Besides O
, O
people O
underestimate O
emotional O
feelings O
in O
their O
workplaces O
. O

The O
reason O
is O
that O
people O
must O
complate B-INCORRECT
their O
tasks O
in O
order O
to O
gain B-INCORRECT
more O
money O
maintain O
lives O
and O
they O
forget O
about O
these O
emotional O
feelings O
such O
as O
love O
, O
helping O
or O
thinking O
spiritual O
things B-INCORRECT
. O

It O
can O
be O
clearly O
seen O
that O
in B-INCORRECT
holidays O
people O
are B-INCORRECT
getting B-INCORRECT
closer O
and O
they O
remember O
their O
feelings O
. O

For O
example O
, O
people O
meet O
their O
relatives O
that O
never B-INCORRECT
see B-INCORRECT
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
people O
have O
a O
chance O
to O
go O
sacred B-INCORRECT
places O
in O
order O
renew O
their O
spirits O
and O
souls O
. O

They O
can O
pray O
for B-INCORRECT
God O
and O
it O
gives B-INCORRECT
a O
relief O
people O
. O

When O
people O
remember O
these O
emotional O
and O
spiritual O
subjects O
they O
can O
become O
more O
happy O
. O
Because B-INCORRECT
need O
to O
leave O
the O
material O
world O

In B-INCORRECT
holidays O
, O
people O
have O
time O
to O
review O
their O
mistakes O
that O
leads B-INCORRECT
stressful B-INCORRECT
life O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
holidays O
are O
very O
suitable O
for O
people O
in B-INCORRECT
order B-INCORRECT
to O
heal O
their O
problems O
and O
stressful O
life O
conditions O
. O

Also O
holidays B-INCORRECT
are O
very O
helpful O
days O
in B-INCORRECT
order B-INCORRECT
to O
revive O
the O
spirit O
and O
soul O
because O
people O
have O
a O
chance O
move B-INCORRECT
away O
modern B-INCORRECT
life O
that B-INCORRECT
has B-INCORRECT
full O
of O
material O
subjects O
. O

Cycling O
to O
school O
, O
work O
or O
do O
any O
other O
activity O
it B-INCORRECT
is O
not O
a O
common O
habit O
in O
Spain O
. O

However O
, B-INCORRECT
the O
government O
and O
local O
councils O
of O
big O
cities O
such O
as O
Madrid O
or O
Valencia O
are O
trying O
their O
best O
to O
promote O
this O
movement O
because O
they O
consider O
it O
a O
way O
development B-INCORRECT
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
there O
are O
many O
benefits O
of B-INCORRECT
cycling O
. O

Firstly O
, O
it B-INCORRECT
reduces O
traffic O
jams O
noise O
and O
pollution O
as O
well O
lowers B-INCORRECT
CO2 O
emissions O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
it O
turns O
out O
to O
be O
the O
quickest O
method B-INCORRECT
of O
transport O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
there O
are O
some O
issues O
such O
as O
increase O
of O
danger O
on O
roads O
. O

Statistically O
cycling B-INCORRECT
is O
generally O
considered O
to O
be O
more O
dangerous O
than O
travelling O
by O
car O
. O

Another O
disadvantage O
is O
the O
weather O
. O

Getting O
wet O
when B-INCORRECT
it O
rains O
, O
having O
to O
do B-INCORRECT
a O
lot O
of O
effort O
cycle O
into O
strong O
wind O
freezing O
weather O
or O
keep O
drinking O
hot O
. O

In B-INCORRECT
my O
point O
of O
view O
, O
Cycling B-INCORRECT
contributes O
to O
improve B-INCORRECT
community O
spirit O
and O
it O
is O
possible O
look O
for O
solutions O
face O
the O
disadvantages O
this O
activity O
. O

No O
one O
can O
deny O
that O
travelling O
by B-INCORRECT
car O
is O
much O
more O
convenient O
than O
public O
transport O
. O

For O
example O
, O
people O
taking O
car B-INCORRECT
do O
not O
need O
to O
spend O
time O
waiting O
for O
the O
bus O
or O
subway O
. O

And O
this O
undesirable O
time B-INCORRECT
might O
be B-INCORRECT
not B-INCORRECT
so O
short O
during O
holidays O
, O
due O
to O
less O
frequent O
schedule B-INCORRECT
. O

Also O
, O
we O
can O
drive O
a O
car O
to O
any O
place O
where O
the O
public O
transport O
perhaps B-INCORRECT
is B-INCORRECT
not B-INCORRECT
able O
reach O
. O

When O
the O
bus O
is O
crowded O
, O
we O
have O
to O
stand O
making O
us O
more O
exhausting B-INCORRECT
especially O
for B-INCORRECT
a O
long O
distance O
. O

Even O
though O
cars O
could B-INCORRECT
provide O
us O
with O
so O
many O
advantages B-INCORRECT
mentioned O
above O
, O
of O
travelling O
by O
public O
transport O
should O
not O
be O
neglected B-INCORRECT
. O

First O
, O
public O
transport O
is O
good O
for O
the O
environment O
compared O
to O
private O
car B-INCORRECT
. O

As O
we O
all O
know O
, O
the O
more O
public B-INCORRECT
transport B-INCORRECT
passengers B-INCORRECT
use B-INCORRECT
less O
car O
exhausts B-INCORRECT
are B-INCORRECT
emitted O
per O
person O
. O

Recently O
, O
several O
studies O
have O
shown O
evidences B-INCORRECT
that O
there O
is O
a O
strong O
relation B-INCORRECT
between O
car O
exhausts B-INCORRECT
and O
lung O
cancers B-INCORRECT
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
public O
transport O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
protecting O
human O
beings O
from O
suffering O
of B-INCORRECT
diseases O
and O
saving B-INCORRECT
life B-INCORRECT
. O

Second O
, O
public O
transport O
saves O
city O
spaces B-INCORRECT
. O

As O
more O
and O
people O
choose O
to O
live O
in O
cities O
, O
nowadays O
our B-INCORRECT
become B-INCORRECT
larger O
crowded O
. O

Correspondingly O
, O
the O
space O
for O
each O
person O
becomes B-INCORRECT
more O
limited O
than O
before O
. O

Provided B-INCORRECT
that B-INCORRECT
every O
citizen O
owns O
a O
car O
and O
use B-INCORRECT
it O
rather O
than O
public O
transport O
for O
travelling O
chance B-INCORRECT
, O
I O
suppose O
our O
streets O
would B-INCORRECT
become O
parking B-INCORRECT
place B-INCORRECT
everyone O
spend O
more O
time O
in O
congesting B-INCORRECT
. O

Last O
but O
not O
the B-INCORRECT
least O
, O
public O
transport O
allows O
people O
to O
do O
other O
things O
which O
is B-INCORRECT
impossible O
when O
driving O
. O

The B-INCORRECT
drivers B-INCORRECT
have O
to O
continuously O
pay O
attention O
surroundings O
, O
resulting O
in O
a O
tense O
spirit B-INCORRECT
. O

For O
a B-INCORRECT
passenger O
, O
however O
travelling O
is O
complete B-INCORRECT
relax B-INCORRECT
. O

People O
can O
listen O
to O
music O
, O
take O
a O
phone O
call O
with O
friend O
read O
fascinating O
book O
or O
just O
loot B-INCORRECT
at O
outside B-INCORRECT
. O

Though O
there O
are O
many O
advantages O
for B-INCORRECT
public O
transport O
, O
it B-INCORRECT
does O
not O
mean O
that O
is O
the O
best O
choice O
every O
situation O
. O

E.g. O
, O
it O
offers O
less O
flexibility O
than O
cars O
and O
is O
environment B-INCORRECT
friendly O
bicycles O
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
is O
unreasonable O
to O
conclude O
that O
one O
transport B-INCORRECT
can O
replace O
others O
. O

It O
is O
better O
that O
people O
are O
aware O
of O
their O
pros O
and O
cons O
choose O
a O
fit B-INCORRECT
one O
. O

Languages O
for O
the O
future O

Should O
learn B-INCORRECT
other O
languages O
? O
. B-INCORRECT

We O
live O
in O
a O
world O
that O
day B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
changes B-INCORRECT
and O
people O
need O
develop O
their O
skills O
overcome O
. O

I O
think O
there O
are O
many O
reasons O
to O
learn O
languages O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
it B-INCORRECT
could O
allow O
you O
to O
communicate O
with O
people O
, O
know B-INCORRECT
different O
cultures O
and O
travel O
around O
word B-INCORRECT
without O
language O
barrier O
. O

Also O
in B-INCORRECT
recent O
years O
to B-INCORRECT
express B-INCORRECT
yourself O
English O
, O
French O
Germany B-INCORRECT
and B-INCORRECT
Russian O
has O
became O
something O
essential O
very B-INCORRECT
important B-INCORRECT
our O
lives O
find O
a O
job O
. O

I O
think O
a O
great O
disadvantage O
is O
the O
price O
of O
course O
. O

Also O
I B-INCORRECT
consider B-INCORRECT
that O
it O
tends O
to O
be O
hard O
and O
takes O
time O
away O
from O
doing O
any O
other O
things O
. O

It O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
young O
people O
should O
spend O
more O
time O
studying O
languages O
because O
it O
will O
be O
profitability B-INCORRECT
in O
the B-INCORRECT
future O
but B-INCORRECT
achieve O
have O
motivated O
and O
enjoy O
learning O
. O

these O
reasons O
I O

Today O
, O
I O
went O
to O
my B-INCORRECT
Winnie O
's O
home B-INCORRECT
with O
Adriana O
in O
the O
afternoon O
. O

We O
ate O
delicious O
food O
and O
play B-INCORRECT
interesting O
games O
altogether B-INCORRECT
. O

We O
had O
a O
great O
time O
. O

At O
2 O
o'clock O
in O
he B-INCORRECT
afternoon O
, O
we O
arrived O
at O
Winnie O
's O
home B-INCORRECT
. O

First O
, O
we O
listened O
to O
some O
songs O
such O
as O
almost B-INCORRECT
and O
big B-INCORRECT
world B-INCORRECT
. O

After O
thirty O
minutes O
, O
we O
had O
tea O
. O

Winnie O
loves B-INCORRECT
eating B-INCORRECT
very B-INCORRECT
much B-INCORRECT
so B-INCORRECT
I O
can O
easily O
find O
food O
at O
her O
home B-INCORRECT
. O

We O
had O
mouth- B-INCORRECT
watering O
strawberry O
cakes O
and O
juicy O
apple O
juice O
for O
tea O
they O
were O
extremely O
yummy O
. O

After O
having O
tea O
, O
we O
play B-INCORRECT
hide O
- O
and O
seek O
altogether B-INCORRECT
in O
Winnie O
's O
garden O
. O

Adriana O
and O
I O
hid O
behind O
a O
bench O
Winnie O
looked O
for O
us O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
Winnie O
fell O
over O
a O
little O
stone O
. O

Adriana O
and O
I O
immediately O
came B-INCORRECT
to O
her O
held B-INCORRECT
up O
. O
' O

Your O
knee O
is O
bleeding O
. O

Are O
you O
okay'I B-INCORRECT
asked O
. O

I O
was O
shaking O
like O
a O
leaf O
and O
my O
heart O
is B-INCORRECT
pounding O
since B-INCORRECT
worried O
about O
Winnie O
. O

I O
had O
butterflies O
in O
my O
stomach.'Yes B-INCORRECT
, O

fine O
' O
Winnie O
replied O
. O

I O
felt O
relieved O
then O
. O

Then O
, O
Adriana O
found O
a O
plaster O
and O
put O
it O
on O
Winnie O
's O
wound O
. O

Winnie O
felt O
warm O
inside O
and O
smiled O
happily O
. O

I O
felt O
glad B-INCORRECT
today O
although B-INCORRECT
Winnie O
hurt O
herself O
. O

Why O
? O

It O
is O
because O
our O
friendship O
more O
rugged O
. O

What O
an O
unfoggetable B-INCORRECT
day O
! O

In O
my O
opinion O
the B-INCORRECT
house O
in B-INCORRECT
future O
will O
be O
better O
. O

House B-INCORRECT
of O
the O
future O
will O
be O
big O
and O
bright O
. O

Inside O
will B-INCORRECT
be O
full O
of O
conveniences O
. O

Big O
spaces O
will O
be O
divided O
in O
a O
few O
zones O
. O

Relaxation O
's B-INCORRECT
, O
learning O
kitchen O
zones O
and B-INCORRECT
so O
on O
. O

In O
house B-INCORRECT
of O
the O
future O
there B-INCORRECT
will O
be O
automatic O
curtains O
reacting O
to O
light O
in O
every O
. O

Television O
will O
be O
cordless O
, O
as O
this O
way O
at O
present O
Internet O
. O

Every O
house O
will O
be O
flexible O
. O

Thanks O
to O
that O
it B-INCORRECT
can O
expand O
or O
reduced B-INCORRECT
. O

Everything O
depends O
on O
the O
number O
of O
people O
. O

Swimming O
is O
my O
favourite O
sport O
. O

Why O
do O
I O
like O
swimming O
? O

Well O
, O
swimming O
has O
always O
been O
an O
Olympic O
sport O
it O
is O
individual O
so B-INCORRECT
depends O
entirely O
on O
the O
swimmer O
's O
efforts O
but O
you O
can O
also O
enjoy O
teamwork O
when O
participate O
in O
competitions O
. O

It O
is O
a O
sport O
that O
requires O
lot O
of O
fitness O
, B-INCORRECT
it B-INCORRECT
can O
be O
learnt O
at O
any O
age O
but B-INCORRECT
children O
start O
to O
learn O
swimming B-INCORRECT
as O
early O
two O
years O
. O

Swimming O
has O
different O
types B-INCORRECT
; O
dolphin O
, O
crawl O
backstroke O
and O
breast O
stroke O
. O

Swimming O
as O
a O
sport O
is O
very O
useful O
in B-INCORRECT
wieght B-INCORRECT
reduction O
if O
you O
are O
obese O
and O
need O
to O
reduce O
your O
, B-INCORRECT
it B-INCORRECT
also O
the B-INCORRECT
best O
for O
asthmatic O
patients O
because B-INCORRECT
strengthens O
chest O
muscles O
decreases O
vulnerability O
of O
those O
respiratory O
infections O
. O

If O
you O
will B-INCORRECT
start O
to O
learn O
swimming B-INCORRECT
, O
choose O
a O
place O
that O
has O
an O
experienced O
coach O
and O
try O
be O
part O
of O
group O
your O
age B-INCORRECT
. O

Hello O
Paul O
, O

I O
enjoyed O
helping O
at O
the O
concert O
which B-INCORRECT
was B-INCORRECT
in O
Antaya O
on B-INCORRECT
October O
. O

I O
had O
a O
great O
time O
with O
people O
who B-INCORRECT
are B-INCORRECT
working O
as O
helper O
for B-INCORRECT
the O
concert O
. O

I O
got O
a O
lot O
of O
experience O
from O
them O
. O

In B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
concert B-INCORRECT
time B-INCORRECT
all B-INCORRECT
people B-INCORRECT
can O
enjoy O
but B-INCORRECT
nobody O
think B-INCORRECT
about O
how O
they O
are B-INCORRECT
preparing B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
. O

I O
saw O
so O
many O
interesting O
things O
during O
the O
preparetion B-INCORRECT
time O
. O

For O
example O
they B-INCORRECT
know O
everything O
about O
each O
helper O
's O
jobs O
but B-INCORRECT
on B-INCORRECT
the O
same O
time O
just B-INCORRECT
concern B-INCORRECT
own B-INCORRECT
subjects O
. O

I O
want O
explain B-INCORRECT
to O
you O
some O
interesting O
part B-INCORRECT
from B-INCORRECT
my O
experience O
. O

In B-INCORRECT
the O
concert B-INCORRECT
morning B-INCORRECT
were B-INCORRECT
excited O
and O
thinking O
about O
we O
decided O
do B-INCORRECT
not B-INCORRECT
think O
just B-INCORRECT
your B-INCORRECT
job B-INCORRECT
which O
would B-INCORRECT
be O
given O
. O

When O
we O
were O
arranging O
concert B-INCORRECT
plan O
made B-INCORRECT
work O
sharing O
for O
all O
of O
us O
. O

Some O
of O
them O
started O
design B-INCORRECT
the O
stage O
, O
some O
checking O
songs B-INCORRECT
volume O
and O
lights O
. O

My O
job O
was O
checking O
songs B-INCORRECT
list O
which O
singers O
would O
perform O
. O

I O
think O
it O
was O
the O
most O
difficult O
part O
of O
concert O
because O
singers B-INCORRECT
. O

They O
were O
always O
wanted B-INCORRECT
to O
change O
some O
songs O
which O
was B-INCORRECT
on O
the O
list O
. O

On B-INCORRECT
the O
concert O
time B-INCORRECT
I B-INCORRECT
was O
really O
worried O
that O
something O
would O
appear B-INCORRECT
suddenly O
. O

Actually O
everybody B-INCORRECT
can B-INCORRECT
be B-INCORRECT
worried O
because O
they O
gave B-INCORRECT
time B-INCORRECT
and O
effort O
for O
it O
. O

Finally O
concert B-INCORRECT
started O
and O
all O
the O
lights O
were O
shining O
like O
stars O
. O

It O
is O
difficult O
to O
explain B-INCORRECT
that O
feeling O
. O

When O
the O
concert O
finished O
I B-INCORRECT
felt O
like O
a O
bird O
which B-INCORRECT
flying O
freely O
. O

Of O
course O
I B-INCORRECT
had O
some O
pain O
in O
my O
legs O
because O
all B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
time B-INCORRECT
was B-INCORRECT
standing B-INCORRECT
. O

However O
, O
I O
like O
to O
be O
a O
volunteer O
on O
enjoyable O
projects O
. O

I O
want O
to O
invite O
you O
our O
next O
concert O
which B-INCORRECT
will O
be O
month O
if B-INCORRECT
have O
any O
time O
please B-INCORRECT
come O
and O
see O
how O
we O
are B-INCORRECT
preparing B-INCORRECT
for O
the O
. O

I O
am O
waiting O
for O
your O
email O
. O

See O
you O
! O

Technology O
is O
changing O
the O
way O
we O
live O
in O
many O
ways O
and O
how O
receive O
use O
information O
probably O
most O
affected O
. O

Regarding O
advertisement B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
technology O
is O
having O
a O
huge O
and O
not O
always O
possitive B-INCORRECT
impact O
on O
outdoor O

From O

we B-INCORRECT
have O
moved O
to O
practically O

imaginable O
spot O
. O

From O
buildings O
with O
enormous O

bright O

to O

The O
recent O
developments O
in O
mobile O
technology O
allows B-INCORRECT
advertisers O
to O
offer O
personalized O
publicity B-INCORRECT
each O
of O
us O
. O

I''m B-INCORRECT
sure O
that O
in B-INCORRECT
the O
very O
near O
future O
, O
if O
I O
have O
been O
looking O
for O
restaurants O

it O
. O

It O
will B-INCORRECT
suit O
me O
sometimes O
, O
and O
it O
even B-INCORRECT
be O
useful O
but O
I O
'm O
also O
sure O
find O
aggresive B-INCORRECT
. O

The O
way O
it O
feels O
aggresive B-INCORRECT
to O
enter O
a O
square O
or O
plaza O
in O
my O
town O
and O
find O
full O
of O
bright O
screens O
, O
no O
matter O
how O
beautiful O
artistic O
the O
pictures O
displayed O
are O
. O

Advertisement B-INCORRECT
might O
be O
considered O
an O
art O
, O
or O
at O
least O
some O
pieces O
are O
really O
artistic O
but O
placed O
on B-INCORRECT
the O
wrong O
spot O
showed B-INCORRECT
time O
they B-INCORRECT
loose B-INCORRECT
side O
. O

But O
, O
technology O
is O
hre B-INCORRECT
for O
best B-INCORRECT
or O
worst B-INCORRECT
and O
we O
have O
to O
learn O
deal O
with O
it O
the O
can O
. O

If O
I O
could O
change O
one O
thing O
in O
my O
life O
, O
would O
like O
to O
house O
. O

I O
'd O
like O
to O
have O
a O
big O
detached O
house O
in O
sububs B-INCORRECT
of O
Artem O
or O
Vladivostok O
. O

So O
that O
I O
could O
live O
more O
freely O
and O
independently O
. O

If O
I O
had O
this O
house O
, O
would O
decorat B-INCORRECT
it O
in O
modern B-INCORRECT
stayl B-INCORRECT
. O

I O
would O
build O
there O
fitness B-INCORRECT
gym O
, O
wardrobe B-INCORRECT
-room B-INCORRECT
swimming B-INCORRECT
pool O
. O

If O
I O
had O
such O
house B-INCORRECT
, O
would O
like O
to O
equip B-INCORRECT
a O
barbecue O
area O
in O
my O
garden O
. O

I O
could O
invite O
my O
friends O
and O
relativs B-INCORRECT
. O

Together O
we O
could O
spend O
time O
in O
pleasant B-INCORRECT
atmosphere O
. O

When O
it O
comes O
to O
my O
favorite O
sport O
, O
tennis O
will O
always O
be O
answer O
. O

Though O
I O
am O
a O
beginner O
of B-INCORRECT
it O
, O
think O
's O
interesting O
since O
requires O
lot O
skills O
to O
be O
master O
which O
sounds O
very O
challenging O
. O

When O
I O
feel O
stressed O
off B-INCORRECT
, O
always O
play O
tennis O
to O
release O
my O
pressure O
. O

If O
you B-INCORRECT
are O
a O
beginner O
of B-INCORRECT
tennis O
, O
my O
advice O
is O
that O
need O
to O
get O
suitable O
rocket B-INCORRECT
for B-INCORRECT
first O
. O

As O
the O
proverb O
goes O
: O
If O
you O
want O
to O
learn O
something O
well O
, O
would B-INCORRECT
need O
get O
right O
tools O
first O
work O
on O
it O
. O

Next O
, O
you O
are O
required O
to O
learn O
every O
basic O
skills B-INCORRECT
step O
by O
. O

Since O
tennis O
requires O
lots O
of O
basic O
skills O
, O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
learn O
these O
important O
technical B-INCORRECT
slowly O
and O
steadily O
may O
get O
hurt O
during O
the B-INCORRECT
practice O
. O

Finally O
, O
finding O
a O
good O
teacher O
is B-INCORRECT
also O
critical O
. O

A O
skilled O
coach O
can O
teach O
you O
the O
best O
skills O
of O
tennis O
. O

Do O
we O
have O
better O
television O
than O
a O
few O
decades O
ago O
? O

Do O
we O
have O
enough O
choices O
in B-INCORRECT
the O
screen O
? O

Can O
you O
imagine O
having O
only O
two O
channels O
and O
not O
playing O
the O
whole O
day O
? O

That O
was O
only O
30 O
years O
ago O
. O

An O
explosion O
of O
channels O
arrived O
to B-INCORRECT
our O
houses O
in O
the O
eighties O
. O

In O
this O
report O
we O
will O
see O
some O
characteristics O
of O
today O
's O
television O
. O

Number B-INCORRECT
of O
Channels B-INCORRECT
are B-INCORRECT
gradually O
reducing B-INCORRECT

In O
our O
country O
one B-INCORRECT
decade O
ago O
when B-INCORRECT
digital O
TV O
arrived O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
new O
channels O
flourished O
. O

All O
tv B-INCORRECT
tried O
to O
get O
several O
licences O
distribute O
their O
shows O
. O

In O
order O
to O
resolve O
some O
deficits B-INCORRECT
budgets B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
today B-INCORRECT
there O
are O
mainly O
two O
TV O
groups O
. O

Less B-INCORRECT
channels O
means O
less B-INCORRECT
choices O
. O

Internet O
TV O
is O
increasing O

It O
costs O
less O
money O
and O
you O
can O
choose O
exactly O
the O
moment O
, O
where O
with O
who O
watching B-INCORRECT
this O
or O
that O
televison B-INCORRECT
program O
. O

You O
just O
follow O
a O
suggestion O
made O
bay B-INCORRECT
someone O
. O

You O
just O
click O
on O
it O
. O

They O
have O
to O
reduce O
their O
budget O

Despite O
of B-INCORRECT
changing O
channels O
we B-INCORRECT
see O
the O
same O
news O
. O

Big O
Broadcast B-INCORRECT
groups O
are O
used O
by O
all O
of O
them O
. O

It O
is O
expensive O
to O
keep O
journalists O
and O
camera B-INCORRECT
all O
around O
the O
world O
. O

It O
is O
cheaper O
to O
buy O
it O
. O

Summary O

TV O
is O
dying O
. O

It O
is O
hard O
to O
compete O
with O
the O
Internet O
. O

Nowadays O
only B-INCORRECT
national O
or O
international O
broadcast B-INCORRECT
groups O
can O
be O
in O
the O
match B-INCORRECT
. O

Perhaps O
political O
reasons O
help O
to O
maintain O
such O
a O
budget O
deficit O
. O

However O
the B-INCORRECT
fact O
is O
that O
there O
a O
countdown O
on O
them O
. O

Dear O
Mrs O
Hopkins O
, O

I O
have O
seen O
your O
advertisement O
in O
the O
newspaper O
and O
am O
writing O
to O
express O
an O
interest O

to O
join B-INCORRECT
your O
small O
group O
on O
a O
trip O
around O
the O
world O
. O

I O
am O
a O
20-year O
- O
old O
student O
from O
Switzerland O
speaking O
German O
, O
French O
and O
English O
keen O
on O
travelling O
. O

With B-INCORRECT
several O
trips O
to O
many O
countries O
I O
have B-INCORRECT
made O
until B-INCORRECT
now B-INCORRECT
, O
would O
say O
that O
already B-INCORRECT
some O
experience O
in B-INCORRECT
travelling O
around O
the O
word O
. O

I O
am O
interested O
in O
to B-INCORRECT
join B-INCORRECT
your O
group O
, O
because O
like O
meeting O
new O
people O
from O
other O
countries O
and O
would O
explore O
around O
the O
world O
. O

For O
ten O
years O
I O
have O
been O
in O
a B-INCORRECT
scout O
group O
which O
learnt O
lot O
about O
different O
kinds B-INCORRECT
to O
find O
way O
or O
orientate O
myself O
the O
wilderness O
. O

Furthermore O
I B-INCORRECT
feel O
suitable O
to O
join O
your O
group O
because O
like O
travelling O
and O
would O
be O
a O
part O
of O
adventure O
. O

I O
look O
forward O
to O
hearing O
from O
you O
. O

Dear O
Steve O
, O

It O
was O
good O
to O
hear O
from O
you O
. O

Basically O
my B-INCORRECT
idea O
is O
to O
use O
this O
trip O
learn O
as O
much O
possible O
, B-INCORRECT
I O
mean O
not O
only O
the O
English O
language O
but O
also O
know B-INCORRECT
more O
about O
your O
culture O
and O
visit O
nice O
places O
of B-INCORRECT
country O
well O
. O

As O
I B-INCORRECT
told O
you O
before O
ca O
n't O
afford O
to O
pay O
this B-INCORRECT
trip O
alone B-INCORRECT
, O
so O
my O
father O
will O
put O
up O
some O
money O
help O
me O
. O

But O
I O
wanna O
find O
a O
job O
to O
help O
him O
with O
the O
bills O
. O

Can O
you O
give O
me O
a O
hand O
on B-INCORRECT
it B-INCORRECT
? O

You O
can O
also O
help O
me O
to O
find O
a O
cheap O
place O
rent O
. O

It O
will O
be O
helpful O
if O
you O
find B-INCORRECT
a O
small O
apartment O
near O
the B-INCORRECT
Cambridge O
University O
where O
I O
'll O
study B-INCORRECT
English O
for O
5 O
months O
. O

Thanks O
for O
all O
your O
help O
and O
I O
look O
forward O
to O
hearing O
from O
you O
. O

Best O
wishes O

Hi O
John O
, O

I O
am O
looking O
forward O
to O
seeing O
you O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
you O
should O
get B-INCORRECT
outside B-INCORRECT
the O
airport O
terminal O
. O

There O
you O
will O
see O
bus O
stations B-INCORRECT
in O
the O
street O
. O

When O
you O
get O
there O
take O
the O
bus O
which O
has O
number O
111 O
. O

Then O
ride O
to O
the O
bus O
stop O
" O
Zličín O
. O

There O
you O
can O
get O
to O
the O
underground O
station O
and O
travel O
centre O
of O
Prague O
. O

If O
you O
choose O
this O
way O
, O
I O
'll O
call O
in O
the O
morning O
to O
tell O
where O
will B-INCORRECT
we B-INCORRECT
meet B-INCORRECT
exactly B-INCORRECT
. O

But O
if B-INCORRECT
I B-INCORRECT
were O
you O
would O
take O
a O
taxi O
for B-INCORRECT
the O
underground O
is O
quite O
boring O
, O
but O
it O
cheaper O
. O

Anyway O
, O
you O
need O
to O
get O
the O
centre O
. O
I O
'll O
wait O
for O
there O

Finally O
, O
the O
weather O
forecast O
for O
next O
month O
looks O
pleasantly B-INCORRECT
as B-INCORRECT
it B-INCORRECT
is O
usual O
at O
this O
time O
of O
year O
. O

That O
's O
why O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
take B-INCORRECT
warm O
clothes O
. O

I O
am O
delighted O
to O
see B-INCORRECT
you O
soon O
. O

Best O
wishes O
, O

Jacob O

In O
my O
opinion O
we B-INCORRECT
should O
go O
to O
the O
restaurant O
because O
all O
people O
need O
a O
relaxing O
moment O
for B-INCORRECT
doing B-INCORRECT
work O
better O
than O
before O
. O

Firstly O
, O
we O
can O
discuss O
type B-INCORRECT
of O
food O
want O
to O
eat O
. O

Actually O
, B-INCORRECT
students O
eat O
a O
lot O
fast B-INCORRECT
food O
while O
they O
are O
studying O
at O
university O
because O
do B-INCORRECT
n't O
have O
time O
to O
for B-INCORRECT
these O
reasons O
I B-INCORRECT
think O
that O
the O
best O
restaurant O
is B-INCORRECT
somowhere B-INCORRECT
when B-INCORRECT
home O
- O
made O
and O
good O
idea O
mains B-INCORRECT
course O
: B-INCORRECT
baked O
potatoes O
steamed O
vegetables O
dessert O
apple B-INCORRECT
cake O
. O

On O
the B-INCORRECT
other O
hand O
, O
we O
are O
studying O
architecture O
maybe B-INCORRECT
should O
choose O
a B-INCORRECT
special O
restaurant O
I B-INCORRECT
like O
charming O
and B-INCORRECT
comfortable O
with O
lot O
of O
windows O
white O
chair O
table O
wall O
more B-INCORRECT
or B-INCORRECT
less B-INCORRECT
relaxing O
environment O
but B-INCORRECT
atmosphere O
is O
very O
important O
for O
dinner O
think O
that O
must B-INCORRECT
vote O
this B-INCORRECT
because O
will O
have O
good O
night O
not O
depending O
type O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
think O
that O
this O
type O
of O
food O
and B-INCORRECT
atmosphere O
is O
very O
for B-INCORRECT
us B-INCORRECT
because O
normally O
we B-INCORRECT
had B-INCORRECT
spoken B-INCORRECT
about O
book B-INCORRECT
work O
studies O
while B-INCORRECT
with O
environment O
can O
speak O
our O
family O
hobbies O
all B-INCORRECT
people B-INCORRECT
get B-INCORRECT
to O
know O
new B-INCORRECT
something B-INCORRECT
other O
mates B-INCORRECT
. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
go O
Foster O
's O
Hollywood O
. O

I O
love O
the O
food O
here B-INCORRECT
and O
think O
my O
classmates O
too B-INCORRECT
. O

You O
can O
it B-INCORRECT
the O
best O
burgers O
you O
have O
ever O
eaten O
. O

They O
are O
incredibily B-INCORRECT
delicious O
. O

I O
do B-INCORRECT
not O
know O
how O
they O
make O
and O
cook O
them O
. O

These O
burgers O
are O
my O
favourite O
food O
because O
they O
amazing O
. O

I O
can O
not O
say O
how B-INCORRECT
they O
are O
because B-INCORRECT
you O
have O
to O
taste O
them O
. O

It O
is O
a O
flavour O
similar O
to O
stay B-INCORRECT
in O
the B-INCORRECT
heaven O
or O
paradise O
. O

I O
recommend O
you O
to O
go O
this O
restaurant O
and O
definitely B-INCORRECT
leave O
with O
a O
very O
good O
flavour O
in B-INCORRECT
your O
mouth O
huge O
smile O
face O
. O

You O
will O
want O
to O
come B-INCORRECT
another O
time O
. O

However O
, O
if O
you B-INCORRECT
do O
not O
like O
burgers O
can O
eat O
whatever O
want B-INCORRECT
of B-INCORRECT
American B-INCORRECT
food B-INCORRECT
and O
will O
get O
the O
same O
fantastic O
opinion B-INCORRECT
as O
a O
person O
who O
has O
eaten O
another O
meal O
. O

Public O
transport O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
our O
modern O
day B-INCORRECT
lives O
. O

More O
than O
a O
billion O
people O
use O
buses O
, O
taxi B-INCORRECT
's B-INCORRECT
and O
trains O
etc O
as B-INCORRECT
tourists O
for O
work O
meeting B-INCORRECT
relatives O
going O
to O
school O
. O

Many O
even O
use O
cars O
. O

Though O
travelling O
by O
car O
is O
more O
convenient O
but B-INCORRECT
it O
expensive O
. O

That O
is O
why B-INCORRECT
because O
the O
cost O
of O
petrol O
, O
diesel O
and O
gas O
quite O
high O
in O
most O
countries O
world O
. O

While O
travelling O
by O
public O
transport O
can O
save O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
in O
following B-INCORRECT
ways O
: O

1 O
. O
People O
can O
save O
the O
money O
they O
spend O
on O
petrol O

2 O
. O

As O
they O
have O
specific O
routes O
across O
the O
country O
, O
town O
city O
and O
villages O
it O
helps O
people O
to O
spend O
less O
in O
shops O
or O
restaurants O
on O
highways O
even O
inside O
etc O
. O

I O
disagree O
with O
the O
statement O
stated B-INCORRECT
above O
because O
in B-INCORRECT
future B-INCORRECT
we B-INCORRECT
are O
likely O
to O
have O
only O
two O
classes O
society O
, B-INCORRECT
rich O
and O
poor O
. O

Middle B-INCORRECT
class O
is O
disappearing O
and O
becoming O
scarce O
day O
by O
. O

It O
is O
because O
of O
high O
taxes O
on O
goods O
. O

So O
, O
I O
believe O
either B-INCORRECT
we B-INCORRECT
will B-INCORRECT
have O
public O
transport O
or O
people O
are B-INCORRECT
going B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
be O
as O
they O
were O
in O
the O
stone O
age O
. O

Public O
transport O
is O
even O
good O
for O
our O
environment O
rather B-INCORRECT
than B-INCORRECT
cars O
. O

Nowadays O
people B-INCORRECT
have O
different O
views O
about O
reading O
books O
and O
watching O
movies O
. O

Some O
of O
them B-INCORRECT
think O
that O
books O
are O
more O
interesting O
than O
film O
versions O
. O

I O
agree O
with O
this O
point O
of O
view O
. O

I O
tend O
to O
think O
that O
there O
is O
nothing O
better O
than O
reading O
a O
book O
. O

Firstly O
, O
reading O
helps O
to B-INCORRECT
become O
a B-INCORRECT
well O
Educated B-INCORRECT
Person B-INCORRECT
and O
give B-INCORRECT
chance O
develop O
knowledge B-INCORRECT
. O

That O
's O
why B-INCORRECT
while O
you O
are O
reading O
getting O
a O
piece O
of O
information O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
books O
develops B-INCORRECT
imagination B-INCORRECT
of O
reader B-INCORRECT
. O

When O
you O
are O
reading O
a B-INCORRECT
picture O
of O
what O
is O
happening O
appears O
in O
your O
mind O
. O

You O
can O
imagine O
how B-INCORRECT
heroes O
look O
Like B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
you O
different O
views B-INCORRECT
where O
the O
action O
takes O
place O
. O

And O
finally O
, O
I O
think O
it O
's O
very O
important O
that O
you O
can O
easily O
take O
your O
book O
with O
and O
start O
reading O
anytime O
want O
. O

On O
the B-INCORRECT
other O
hand O
, O
if O
you O
like O
being O
in O
company O
best O
way B-INCORRECT
for O
is O
movies O
. O

Because O
you O
can O
watch O
it B-INCORRECT
with O
your O
friends O
. O

Also O
many B-INCORRECT
people O
choose O
movies O
because O
they O
like O
soundtracks O
and O
special O
effects O
. O

It O
's O
so O
exciting O
. O

but B-INCORRECT
all O
these O
factors O
are O
not O
important O
for B-INCORRECT
me O
. O

I O
suppose B-INCORRECT
that O
books O
are O
better O
than O
them B-INCORRECT
film O
version B-INCORRECT
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
say O
reading B-INCORRECT
is O
really B-INCORRECT
great O
thing O
. O

A O
girl O
was O
walking O
home O
one O
day O
. O

She O
was O
with O
her O
mum O
.. B-INCORRECT

She O
was O
just O
a O
young O
beautiful O
girl O
! O

So O
, O
they O
were O
going O
home O
when O
the O
girl O
noticed O
a O
cute O
doll O
in O
shop O
. O

She O
had O
blond O
hair O
and O
she O
was O
wearing O
a O
blue O
dress O
, O
white O
gloves O
black O
shoes O
. O

Just O
like O
her O
... O
''Mum O
I O
love O
this O
doll!Could B-INCORRECT
you O
bye B-INCORRECT
it O
for O
me O
? O
'' O
she O
said O
. O

Her O
mum O
could O
n't O
deny B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
her O
, O
so O
she O
bought O
it O
. O

Oh!The O
girl O
had O
so O
many O
special O
moments O
with O
her O
doll!!They B-INCORRECT
looked O
adorable O
together!They B-INCORRECT
were O
like O
twins O
! O

After O
some O
years O
the B-INCORRECT
girl O
decided O
that O
she O
had O
to O
move O
. O

She O
was O
eighteen O
years O
old O
, O
she O
had O
to O
be O
indepedent B-INCORRECT
. O

So O
she O
took O
a O
deep O
breath O
and O
put O
her O
doll O
in O
the O
attic O
just B-INCORRECT
like O
childhood O
memories O
. O

At O
night O
she O
heard O
some O
creepy O
noises O
from O
there O
... O

She O
went O
there O
and O
thera B-INCORRECT
was O
the O
doll O
with O
a O
knife O
in O
her O
hand.''Bell B-INCORRECT
, O
why O
you B-INCORRECT
do B-INCORRECT
n't B-INCORRECT
play O
me B-INCORRECT
anymore?Are B-INCORRECT
boring B-INCORRECT
of O
me?Just B-INCORRECT
because O
I O
have O
only O
one O
eye?But B-INCORRECT
removed O
other O
. O

Just O
because O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
one O
if B-INCORRECT
my O
gloves?But B-INCORRECT
you O
did O
it O
again!''she B-INCORRECT
screamed O
. O

And O
then O
... O

Next O
day O
, O
going O
at B-INCORRECT
her B-INCORRECT
home O
mum O
wanted O
to O
find O
daughter O
. O

So O
, O
she O
went O
upstairs O
... O

The O
girl O
had O
a O
knife O
in O
her O
kneck B-INCORRECT
and O
on O
the O
wall O
there O
was O
sentence,''Why B-INCORRECT

that O
way O

Tennis O
is O
an O
individual O
sport O
. O

Just B-INCORRECT
you B-INCORRECT
have O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
game O
. O

You O
can O
choose O
lots O
of O
places O
to O
play O

You O
need O
a O
good O

person B-INCORRECT
who B-INCORRECT
play O

Although O
you O

can O
lose O

This O
sport O

not O
just O
about O
a B-INCORRECT
physical O
power O
. O

You O
supposed B-INCORRECT
to O

It O

I O

Some O

to O
play O

of O
money O

glory O

Some O
of O
them O
practise B-INCORRECT
tennis O
because O
their O

It O
is O
not O
fair O
enough B-INCORRECT

Essay O

In O
today O
's O
essay O
I O
am O
going O
to O
focus O
on O
the O
pros O
and O
cons O
of O
studying O
English O
abroad O
. O

Is O
it O
really O
worth O
leaving O
your O
own O
country O
for O
a O
period O
of O
time O
to O
study O
English O
? O

It O
is O
true O
that O
going O
abroad O
can O
open O
new O
point O
of O
views O
about O
your O
own O
learning O
process O
. O

Talking O
with O
English O
native O
speakers O
is O
always O
a O
good O
thing O
because B-INCORRECT
you O
will O
be O
able O
to O
judge O
how O
well O
or O
badly O
are O
doing O
. O

Besides O
, O
it O
can O
be O
funny B-INCORRECT
and O
enjoyable O
if O
you O
plan O
properly O
. O

However O
, O
you O
will O
have O
to B-INCORRECT
spend O
a O
considerable O
amount O
of O
money O
in B-INCORRECT
it O
and O
not O
be B-INCORRECT
assured B-INCORRECT
achieve O
your O
goals O
at O
all O
so B-INCORRECT
would B-INCORRECT
able B-INCORRECT
become O
real O
nightmare O
if O
are B-INCORRECT
focus O
on O
learning O
tasks O
. O

From O
my O
point O
of O
view O
I B-INCORRECT
think O
the O
advantages O
overcome B-INCORRECT
disadvantages O
especially B-INCORRECT
if O
you O
have O
some O
money O
saved O
for O
it O
. O

But O
if O
you O
do O
not O
, O
there O
is O
always O
a B-INCORRECT
solution O
which B-INCORRECT
using O
the O
Internet O
to O
learn O
everything O
need O
. O

You O
can O
even O
talk O
with O
native O
speakers O
by O
using O
some O
Chat O
Rooms O
online O
such O
as O
Skipe B-INCORRECT
and O
others O
. O

Football O
, O
a O
passion O

When O
I B-INCORRECT
was O
little O
had B-INCORRECT
tried O
a O
lot O
of O
sports O
, B-INCORRECT
Handball B-INCORRECT
Swimming B-INCORRECT
Tennis B-INCORRECT
but O
my O
favourite O
sport O
is O
not O
one O
those O
it O
that O
have B-INCORRECT
never O
imagine O
: O
Football B-INCORRECT
. O

All O
my O
life O
I O
thought O
that O
football O
was O
a O
sport O
which O
for O
men O
, B-INCORRECT
not O
girls O
but B-INCORRECT
once O
tried O
it O
loved O
. O

Have O
you O
ever O
think B-INCORRECT
about O
playing O
football O
? O

At O
first O
, B-INCORRECT
when O
I B-INCORRECT
started O
to O
play B-INCORRECT
football O
did O
it O
with O
my O
classmates O
who O
where B-INCORRECT
all O
boys O
so O
used O
feel O
a O
little O
bit O
uncomfortable O
however B-INCORRECT
some O
years O
ago O
they O
intergrate B-INCORRECT
me O
and O
nowadays O
love O
playing O
them O
. O

Now O
, B-INCORRECT
some O
women B-INCORRECT
and O
I O
started B-INCORRECT
to O
organize O
female O
matches O
so O
am O
more O
used O
play B-INCORRECT
with O
girls O
. O
never O
imagine B-INCORRECT
that O
was O
going O
be O
keen O
on O
football O
but O
now O
it O
takes B-INCORRECT
part O
of O
my O
life O

I O
think O
football O
is O
a O
very O
exciting O
sport O
, O
and O
that O
everybody O
in O
the O
world O
should O
try O
it O
at O
least O
once O
his O
or O
her O
life O
. O

One O
thing O
you O
should O
keep O
in O
mind O
if O
want O
to O
play O
football O
is B-INCORRECT
that O
have O
be O
ready O
reacive B-INCORRECT
some O
punches O
. O

I O
recommend O
you B-INCORRECT
a O
great O
restaurant O
which O
is O
in O
the O
shopping O
center O
. O

I O
have O
been O
there O
twice O
, O
and O
like O
it O
. O

Its O
name O
is O
" O
The O
English O
oven O
, O
and O
it O
's O
a O
fantastic O
traditional B-INCORRECT
modern O
restaurant O
with O
British O
food O
. O

The O
service O
is O
excellent O
and O
the O
waiters O
are O
so O
pleasant O
gentle B-INCORRECT
. O

The O
interior O
is O
big O
, O
so O
all O
the O
class O
could O
stay B-INCORRECT
inside O
without O
problems O
. O

The O
decoration O
is O
modern O
and O
cozy O
, O
it O
's O
got O
some O
great O
traditional O
British O
objects O
. O

The O
food O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
things O
in O
restaurant O
that B-INCORRECT
always O
tasty O
and O
fresh O
. O

The've O
got O
a O
lot O
of O
different O
dishes O
, O
traditional O
and O
modern O
. O

They O
have O
also O
got O
a O
lot O
of O
different O
types O
salads O
, O
pasta O
and O
pizzas O
. O

The O
desserts O
are O
very O
good O
too O
. O

They O
've O
got O
original O
ones O
, O
like O
sweet O
pizza O
and O
traditional O
. B-INCORRECT

There O
is O
a O
big O
variety O
of O
ice O
creams O
. O

This O
restaurant O
is O
not O
too O
expensive O
, O
which O
perfect O
for O
us O
because O
we O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
spend O
much O
money O
. O

The O
restaurant O
is O
in O
the O
shopping O
center O
, O
so O
we O
can O
get O
there O
by O
bus O
or O
train O
. O

I O
think O
this O
is O
the O
best O
restaurant O
to O
go O
on B-INCORRECT
end O
of O
course O
, O
so O
we O
could O
book O
some O
tables O
as O
soon O
possible O
because O
a O
lot O
people O
usually O
goes B-INCORRECT
there O
. O

During B-INCORRECT
whole B-INCORRECT
life B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
famous B-INCORRECT
people B-INCORRECT
such B-INCORRECT
as B-INCORRECT
politicians B-INCORRECT
and B-INCORRECT
film B-INCORRECT
stars B-INCORRECT
media B-INCORRECT
are B-INCORRECT
accompanying B-INCORRECT
them B-INCORRECT
. O

In O
my O
view O
, O
public O
person B-INCORRECT
deserve O
to O
have O
their O
own O
life O
without O
photographing B-INCORRECT
. O

In B-INCORRECT
one O
hand O
, O
becoming O
a O
public O
person B-INCORRECT
associate B-INCORRECT
with O
jornalist B-INCORRECT
mass O
- O
media O
flashes O
. O

Famous O
people O
are O
obligated O
to O
provide B-INCORRECT
their O
life B-INCORRECT
in O
exemplary B-INCORRECT
way O
. O

However O
, O
they B-INCORRECT
still B-INCORRECT
being B-INCORRECT
ordinary O
people O
make O
mistakes O
. O

People O
are O
thought O
being B-INCORRECT
jealous O
. O

Notice B-INCORRECT
any O
kind O
of O
failures B-INCORRECT
. O

It O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
journalist B-INCORRECT
might O
be O
absolutely O
toxic O
and O
they O
have O
defective B-INCORRECT
infulence B-INCORRECT
on O
society O
which B-INCORRECT
assess B-INCORRECT
celebrites B-INCORRECT
through O
the O
prism O
of O
journalistic O
documentary O
. O

In B-INCORRECT
the O
other O
hand O
many B-INCORRECT
of B-INCORRECT
stars O
sold B-INCORRECT
their O
privacy O
to O
earn O
more O
and O
money O
. O

The O
value O
of O
their O
talent O
, B-INCORRECT
abilities O
are B-INCORRECT
counted B-INCORRECT
in O
amonut B-INCORRECT
tabloids O
scandals O
. O

Summing O
up O
, O
all O
over O
the B-INCORRECT
world O
are B-INCORRECT
living B-INCORRECT
famous O
people O
who O
do O
n't O
bring O
into B-INCORRECT
limelight B-INCORRECT
their B-INCORRECT
life B-INCORRECT
. O

It O
has O
ever B-INCORRECT
been O
very O
useful O
for B-INCORRECT
a O
long O
time O
ago O
, B-INCORRECT
nevertheless B-INCORRECT
nowadays B-INCORRECT
there O
are O
some O
people O
who O
ask O
if B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
public O
transport O
was O
suppressed O
and B-INCORRECT
society O
would O
save O
lot O
of O
money O
. O

However O
, O
people O
should O
think O
about O
the O
large B-INCORRECT
advantages O
such O
as O
: O
save O
money O
; O
it O
is O
very O
comfortable B-INCORRECT
and O
good O
for O
environment O
. O

Firstly O
, O
the B-INCORRECT
main O
reason O
is O
cost O
because B-INCORRECT
people O
who O
do O
not O
have O
a O
car O
they B-INCORRECT
need O
to O
travel O
or O
commute O
another O
place O
and O
very O
expensive O
. O

The B-INCORRECT
cars B-INCORRECT
need O
to O
be O
repaired O
; B-INCORRECT
besides B-INCORRECT
, O
if O
you O
have O
a O
car O
pay O
some O
taxes O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
these O
people O
need O
to O
have O
public O
transport O
for O
travelling O
around O
the O
country O
and O
city O
. O

Secondly O
, O
another O
reason O
is O
the B-INCORRECT
global O
warming O
because B-INCORRECT
atmosphere O
much B-INCORRECT
polluted O
. O

If O
you O
use O
the B-INCORRECT
public O
transport B-INCORRECT
, O
can O
be B-INCORRECT
less O
contaminating B-INCORRECT
than O
before O
because B-INCORRECT
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
who O
travel O
together O
in O
only O
one O
. O

Finally O
, O
the B-INCORRECT
last O
reason O
is O
comfort B-INCORRECT
because B-INCORRECT
you B-INCORRECT
have O
a O
car B-INCORRECT
; B-INCORRECT
it O
so O
difficult O
to O
find O
park B-INCORRECT
in O
centre O
of O
city O
. O

Besides O
in B-INCORRECT
some O
cities O
, O
car B-INCORRECT
can O
not O
be O
parked O
places O
such O
as O
: B-INCORRECT
the O
old O
city O
and O
centre O
. O

Summing O
up O
, O
people O
are O
aware O
of O
global O
warming O
and O
think O
about O
the O
high O
cost O
having O
a O
car O
. O

From B-INCORRECT
my B-INCORRECT
point B-INCORRECT
of B-INCORRECT
view B-INCORRECT
, O
I O
get B-INCORRECT
used O
to O
walking O
around O
city O
and O
car O
is O
just B-INCORRECT
if O
travel O
the O
country O
. O

We O
are O
living O
in O
a B-INCORRECT
ever O
changing O
world O
. O

Today O
's O
new O
things O
become O
of O
past B-INCORRECT
in O
few B-INCORRECT
months O
. O

Take O
an B-INCORRECT
example O
of O
mobile O
technology O
, B-INCORRECT
your B-INCORRECT
latest B-INCORRECT
handset O
with O
configurations O
becomes O
outdated O
within O
few B-INCORRECT
months O
after B-INCORRECT
buying O
it O
. O

50 O
years O
is O
a O
very O
long O
time O
and O
people O
lives B-INCORRECT
will O
definitely O
change O
in O
such O
period O
. O

However O
, O
the O
important O
point O
to O
discuss O
would B-INCORRECT
be B-INCORRECT
whether O
it O
a O
positive O
change O
or O
negative B-INCORRECT
one O
. O

Last B-INCORRECT
50 O
years O
science B-INCORRECT
and O
technology O
took O
great O
leaps O
, B-INCORRECT
internet O
mobiles O
made O

Today O
, O
we O
have O
all O
the O

Today O
, B-INCORRECT
we O

to O
worry O
about O
getting O
lost O
at B-INCORRECT
new O
place O
Google O
maps O
are B-INCORRECT
always O
there O
help O
. O

We O
need B-INCORRECT
not B-INCORRECT
to O
cram B-INCORRECT
English O
words O
today O
, O
as O
we O
can O
quickly O
find O
meaning B-INCORRECT
of O
any O

on O
our O

Meeting O

need O
to O

anyone O
everything O

be O
managed O
through O
a B-INCORRECT
virtual O

. O

Today O
our O
lives O
have O
become O
much O
more O
comfortable O
than O
past B-INCORRECT
, O
thanks O
to O
progress B-INCORRECT
mankind O
has O
made O
in B-INCORRECT
technology O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
a B-INCORRECT
number B-INCORRECT
of B-INCORRECT
terrorism O
, O
global O
warming O
and O
greed O
became B-INCORRECT
top O
challenges O
today O
's O
world O
. O

Climate O
changes B-INCORRECT
due O
to O
global O
warming O
causing O
natural O
disasters O
now O
and O
then O
. O

Terrorist O
activities O
causing O
havoc O
in O

Corruption B-INCORRECT
and O
greed O
of O
people O
in O
power O
making O
it O
difficult O
to O
trust O

If O
these O
challenges O
are O
not O
addressed O
in B-INCORRECT
coming B-INCORRECT
years O
, O
imagining O
better O
lives O
for O
people O
50 O
hence O
is O
rather O
difficult O
. O

We O
need O
to O
remember O
technology O
is O
just O
a O
tool O
, B-INCORRECT
in B-INCORRECT
right O
hand B-INCORRECT
it O
would B-INCORRECT
be O
boon B-INCORRECT
for O
us O
wrong B-INCORRECT

we O
see B-INCORRECT
today O

to B-INCORRECT
who B-INCORRECT

I O

That O
's O
soon B-INCORRECT
said B-INCORRECT

I O

had B-INCORRECT
a O

well O
. O

I O
've O
worked O
as O
social B-INCORRECT

educators B-INCORRECT
since O
was O
16 O
. O

I O
love O

When O
I O
worked O
as O
educator B-INCORRECT
, O
used O
to O
plan O
and O
manage O
some O
sports O
outdoor O
acitivities B-INCORRECT
. O

I O
had B-INCORRECT
a B-INCORRECT
very B-INCORRECT
great O
memories O
of O
these O

would O
really O
like O
to O

If O
you O

please O
have O
a O
look O
at O
my O
CV O

As O
you O
requested O
, O
I O
attach O
it O
in B-INCORRECT
this O
mail B-INCORRECT
. O

Best O
regards O
. O

Personally O
, O
mobile O
phones O
are O
very O
important O
in O
my O
life O
. O

I O
need O
that O
device O
near O
me O
because O
have O
three O
children O
and O
want O
to O
know O
how O
where O
they O
are O
. O

The O
same O
about B-INCORRECT
my O
parents O
; O
they O
are O
old O
and O
sometimes O
call O
me O
for B-INCORRECT
talk O
their O
healht B-INCORRECT
. O

Concerning O
video O
- O
games O
, O
I O
agree O
with O
scientits B-INCORRECT
that O
they B-INCORRECT
thought B-INCORRECT
its B-INCORRECT
help B-INCORRECT
children O
's O
brain B-INCORRECT
to O
develop O
but O
is B-INCORRECT
important O
controller B-INCORRECT
them O
because B-INCORRECT
there O
are O
a O
lot O
violent B-INCORRECT
. O

However O
there B-INCORRECT
are O
brilliant O
games O
for O
children O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
the O
Internet O
is O
absolutely O
a O
revolution O
in O
current O
society O
. O

It O
is O
very O
common O
to O
use O
the O
Internet O
in O
my O
work O
for B-INCORRECT
research O
or B-INCORRECT
google O
information O
and O
also O
connect O
whit B-INCORRECT
other O
teachers O
, O
speak O
about O
courses O
change B-INCORRECT
. O

Finally O
, O
I O
think O
technological O
developments O
make O
us O
improve O
to B-INCORRECT
the O
future O
. O

Friends O
should O
be O
like O
a O
shadow O
always O
beside O
you O
. O

In O
the B-INCORRECT
time B-INCORRECT
of O
joy O
and O
sorrow O
. O

Nothing O
is O
impossible O
in O
life O
but B-INCORRECT
not B-INCORRECT
doubt B-INCORRECT
it O
easy O
to O
find O
sincere O
friends O
. O

It B-INCORRECT
does O
not O
mean O
you O
will O
never O
find O
one O
. O

It O
is O
very O
important O
to O
interact O
and O
socialise O
with O
people O
make O
a O
friend O
. O

The O
more B-INCORRECT
people O
you O
will B-INCORRECT
meet O
the B-INCORRECT
easy B-INCORRECT
it O
become O
for O
to O
find O
a O
friend O
. O

When O
you O
find O
one O
spend B-INCORRECT
time O
with O
them O
, O
share O
views O
ideas O
and O
go O
out O
. O

Friends O
do O
not O
have O
to O
agree O
on B-INCORRECT
everything O
you O
say O
but B-INCORRECT
they O
should O
share O
their O
views O
about O
it O
. O

The O
Guardian O
is O
a O
British O
daily O
newspaper O
which O
includes O
national O
and O
international O
news O
. O

You O
could B-INCORRECT
find O
a O
variety O
of O
articles O
such B-INCORRECT
as O
politics O
, O
Business O
and O
Money O
sports O
culture O
education O
Life O
style O
Travels B-INCORRECT
the O
weather O
Environment B-INCORRECT
. O

there B-INCORRECT
are O
plenty O
of O
advertisements O
for O
jobs O
and O
donations O
to O
help O
individuals O
. O

readers B-INCORRECT
are O
able O
to O
express O
their O
opinion O
freely O
. O

they O
use O
a B-INCORRECT
quality B-INCORRECT
English O
language B-INCORRECT
which O
avoids O
slang O
. O

As O
result B-INCORRECT
, O
it O
is O
suitable O
for O
students O
who O
learn O
English O
Language O
to O
improve O
their O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
I O
realised O
there O
were O
two O
disadvantages O
. O

For O
example O
, O
it O
is O
not O
suitable O
for O
children O
due O
to O
official O
Language B-INCORRECT
. O
there B-INCORRECT
were O
also O
a O
huge O
number O
of O
commercials O
advertisements O
which O
make O
the O
readers O
bored O

Overall O
, O
The O
Guardian O
is O
considered O
one O
of O
the O
best O
newspapers O
in O
world O
. O

Nowadays O
, O
in O
the O
modern O
and O
progressive O
world O
where O
people O
are O
smart O
economy B-INCORRECT
very O
highly O
developed O
. O

Some O
people O
think O
that O
we O
need O
in B-INCORRECT
tablet O
computers O
instead O
books B-INCORRECT

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
the O
problem O
is O
very O
interesting O
. O

Sometimes O
then B-INCORRECT
I B-INCORRECT
am O
watching O
TV O
or O
reading O
newspaper B-INCORRECT
notice O
that O
gadgets O
become B-INCORRECT
very O
useful O
for B-INCORRECT
our O
life O
.It B-INCORRECT
seems B-INCORRECT
to O
me O
good B-INCORRECT
opportunities O
make O
more B-INCORRECT
easily B-INCORRECT
. O

Also O
it B-INCORRECT
makes B-INCORRECT
us O
more B-INCORRECT
clever B-INCORRECT
. O

I O
am O
convinced O
that O
using O
tablet O
computers O
in O
our O
everyday O
life O
is O
rather B-INCORRECT
good O
. O

People O
do O
not O
need O
to O
carry O
a O
lot O
of O
books B-INCORRECT
in B-INCORRECT
bag O
.Pupil B-INCORRECT
could B-INCORRECT
say O
that O
he O
left B-INCORRECT
book O
because O
has O
all O
his O
tablet O
computers B-INCORRECT

Some O
people O
think O
that O
it O
is O
a O
bed B-INCORRECT
idea O
. O

They O
believe O
that O
it O
is O
useless B-INCORRECT
thing O
for O
our O
generation O
. O

Such O
people O
are O
sure O
that O
electronic O
things O
make O
us O
stupid O
. O

They O
insist O
on O
not O
using O
tablets O
at O
school O
. O

Personally O
for B-INCORRECT
me O
, O
I B-INCORRECT
like O
books O
very O
much O
.when B-INCORRECT
at B-INCORRECT
home O
use O
because O
to O
smell O
and O
touch O
the O
paper O
of O
. O

I O
do O
not O
agree O
with O
the O
people O
who O
think O
that O
tablets O
are O
useless O
. O

We O
should O
use O
it B-INCORRECT
but O
we O
are B-INCORRECT
must O
not O
forget O
about O
books O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
want O
to O
say O
that B-INCORRECT
we O
should O
keep O
abreast O
of O
new O
technologies O
and O
try O
make O
our O
lives O
easier O

The O
Big O
Mistake O

This O
day O
was O
full O
of O
joy O
and O
happiness O
, O
but O
something O
went O
wrong O
after B-INCORRECT
when O
she O
told O
him O
that O
is B-INCORRECT
pregnant O
. O

She O
was O
so O
happy O
about O
this O
news O
and O
she O
thought O
that O
he O
will B-INCORRECT
be O
as O
well O
, O
but O
... O

At O
the O
moment O
when O
she O
told O
him O
that O
is B-INCORRECT
pregnant O
, O
he O
just O
frozen O
. O

It O
was O
too O
much O
for O
him O
. O

He O
thought O
it O
's B-INCORRECT
easier O
to O
walk O
away O
and O
avoid O
this O
conversation O
with O
her O
. O

He O
tried O
to O
understand O
what O
's B-INCORRECT
going O
on O
with O
him O
. O

It O
was O
weird O
how O
many O
questions O
and O
doubts O
came O
up B-INCORRECT
on B-INCORRECT
his O
head O
. O

One O
part O
of B-INCORRECT
him O
was O
really O
happy O
, O
because O
to O
be O
a O
father O
is B-INCORRECT
his B-INCORRECT
one B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
biggest O
dream B-INCORRECT
but O
on O
other O
hand O
he B-INCORRECT
could O
n't O
handle O
this O
news O
. O

This O
woman O
, O
who O
stands B-INCORRECT
next O
to O
him O
is B-INCORRECT
his O
girlfriend O
future O
wife O
. O

He O
should O
be O
happy O
and O
hug O
her O
celebrate O
this O
good O
news O
. O

But O
somehow O
he O
did O
n't O
feel O
anything O
. O

All O
that O
he O
felt O
was O
anxiety O
. O

He O
could O
n't O
handle O
the O
feeling O
, O
when O
she O
tried O
to O
touch O
him O
kiss O
and O
hug O
. O

He O
knew O
that O
she O
loves B-INCORRECT
him O
as O
much O
he O
her O
, O
but O
everything O
was O
just O
too B-INCORRECT
wrong O
on B-INCORRECT
this O
moment O
. O

Her O
voice O
, O
her O
smile O
and O
even O
body O
was O
to B-INCORRECT
wrong O
on O
this O
moment O
. O

She O
could O
n't O
understand O
what O
's B-INCORRECT
going O
on O
, O
because O
it O
was O
just O
three O
weeks O
ago O
when B-INCORRECT
they O
had O
a O
conversation O
about O
kids O
and O
family O
he O
said O
that O
would O
like O
to O
have O
with O
her O
. O

And O
now O
, O
he O
just B-INCORRECT
avoids B-INCORRECT
her O
and O
is B-INCORRECT
not O
happy O
about O
the O
news O
. O

It O
was O
a O
big O
mess O
. O

She O
was O
more O
than O
happy O
and O
he O
could O
n't O
handle O
this O
news O
. O

They O
both O
knew O
that O
they O
love B-INCORRECT
each O
other O
and O
care B-INCORRECT
about O
, O
but O
it O
was O
too O
much O
for O
him O
. O

He O
stood O
up O
and O
said O
to O
her B-INCORRECT
girlfriend O
that O
he O
needs B-INCORRECT
a O
break O
have B-INCORRECT
be O
alone O
. O

Michael O
closed O
the O
door O
and O
knew O
at O
that O
moment O
he O
had O
made O
a O
mistake O
. O

To O
the B-INCORRECT
beginning B-INCORRECT
I B-INCORRECT
am O
going O
to O
take B-INCORRECT
about O
what O
is O
my O
lovely B-INCORRECT
sports B-INCORRECT
and O
why O
will B-INCORRECT
enjoy O
sport O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
I O
do O
not O
like O
to B-INCORRECT
some B-INCORRECT
sports O
during B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
anytime B-INCORRECT
but O
if O
really O
need O
exercises B-INCORRECT
that B-INCORRECT
go O
swim B-INCORRECT
in O
swimming O
pool O
. O

Firstly O
, B-INCORRECT
I O
think O
swimming B-INCORRECT
pool O
is O
clearing O
. O

Such B-INCORRECT
as B-INCORRECT
after B-INCORRECT
swimming O
that B-INCORRECT
I O
have O
a O
safe O
and O
bathroom O
to O
take O
shower B-INCORRECT
. O

Secondly O
, B-INCORRECT
I O
do O
not O
like O
to O
go O
beach B-INCORRECT
this B-INCORRECT
is O
because O
big B-INCORRECT
sun B-INCORRECT
and O
sand O
. O

Third O
, O
swimming O
in O
the O
ocean O
is O
most B-INCORRECT
dangerous O
. O

However O
, O
I O
like O
to O
stay O
in O
the O
swimming O
pool O
during O
summer O
. O

Actually O
, O
I O
do O
not O
know O
how O
to O
swim O
but B-INCORRECT
it O
is O
my B-INCORRECT
favorite O
sport O
in B-INCORRECT
whole B-INCORRECT
life B-INCORRECT
. O

Moreover O
, O
I O
think O
before O
any B-INCORRECT
kind O
of O
sports O
that B-INCORRECT
we O
should O
do O
some O
exercises O
is O
because O
need O
to O
relax O
our O
bodies O
first O
. O
If O
not O
it B-INCORRECT
will O
get O
dangerous O
while O
are O
doing O

In O
conclusion O
, O
my B-INCORRECT
opinion B-INCORRECT
is B-INCORRECT
I O
do O
not O
like O
to O
any O
sports O
but B-INCORRECT
we O
need O
choose O
one O
kind O
of O
sport O
in O
our O
life O
and O
almost O
all O
people O
it O
as O
could B-INCORRECT
stay O
at O
home O
or O
working B-INCORRECT
the O
time O
. O

Even O
you B-INCORRECT
really O
do O
not O
like O
to B-INCORRECT
exercise O
that B-INCORRECT
can O
go O
shop B-INCORRECT
. O

The O
purpose O
of O
this O
report O
is O
to O
outline O
the O
most O
important O
actions O
which O
have O
been O
taken O
in O
our O
town O
protect O
environment O
as O
main O
issue O
improve O
quality O
life O
. O

In O
the O
first O
place O
, O
we O
need O
to O
pay O
attention O
fact O
that O
Caceres O
is O
located O
in O
a O
pasture O
area O
where O
local O
farmers O
have O
been O
breeding O
sheep O
cows O
and O
pigs O
for O
centuries O
spite O
of O
hard O
weather O
conditions O
such O
as O
high O
temperatures O
terrible O
drought O
summer O
. O

As O
a B-INCORRECT
result O
, O
our O
water O
resources O
are O
difficult O
to O
be B-INCORRECT
preserved B-INCORRECT
and O
it O
is O
clearly O
necessary O
maintain O
active O
campaigns O
raise O
people O
's O
awareness O
about B-INCORRECT
the O
importance O
of O
rational B-INCORRECT
use O
. O

The O
local O
government O
is O
also O
taking O
strong B-INCORRECT
action O
on B-INCORRECT
creating O
green O
areas O
in O
different O
places O
or O
around O
the O
town O
where O
citizens O
can O
spend O
their O
free O
time O
even O
do O
sports O
. O

That O
's O
the O
reason O
why O
it O
has O
been O
working O
on O
recovery O
of O
some O
areas O
which O
are O
now O
parks O
or O
recreational O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O
town O
has O
also O
improved O
management O
and O
treatment O
of O
waste O
system B-INCORRECT
with O
active O
cooperation O
most O
citizenship B-INCORRECT
who B-INCORRECT
is B-INCORRECT
really O
concerned O
about O
recycling O
need B-INCORRECT
. O

In O
fact O
, O
around O
90% O
of O
Caceres O
inhabitants O
are O
said O
to O
sort O
and O
recycle O
their O
rubbish O
taking B-INCORRECT
it O
out O
the O
yellow O
green O
blue O
containers O
in O
every O
street O
. O

And O
that O
is O
the B-INCORRECT
negative O
point O
, B-INCORRECT
these B-INCORRECT
dumpsters O
are O
too O
visible O
in O
town O
and O
it O
would O
be O
advisable O
to O
change B-INCORRECT
ones O
we O
have O
for O
underground O
. O

I O
woke O
up O
today O
and O
just B-INCORRECT
remember B-INCORRECT
that O
was O
doing O
a O
presentation O
about O
landscapes O
, O
the O
ones O
do B-INCORRECT
it O
will B-INCORRECT
reward B-INCORRECT
bonus O
point O
but B-INCORRECT
anyways O
this B-INCORRECT
is O
n't O
important O
information O
. O

I O
searched O
my B-INCORRECT
family O
in B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
house O
and O
there O
was O
no O
one O
home O
, O
just O
me O
. O

I O
get B-INCORRECT
a O
bit O
scared O
so B-INCORRECT
search B-INCORRECT
them B-INCORRECT
outside O
in O
the O
streets O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
knew B-INCORRECT
that O
a O
bomb O
hit B-INCORRECT
on B-INCORRECT
the O
city O
and O
killed O
almost O
everyone O
, B-INCORRECT
now B-INCORRECT
have B-INCORRECT
to O
find O
my O
parents O
. O

I O
think O
the O
reason O
why O
did O
n't O
know O
about O
explosion O
is O
because O
this O
part O
where O
live O
a O
very O
poor O
area O
and O
it O
's O
not O
that O
beautiful O
so B-INCORRECT
you O
ca O
distinguish O
were B-INCORRECT
does B-INCORRECT
hit O
. O

Finally O
in B-INCORRECT
some O
days O
I B-INCORRECT
found O
neighbors O
with O
food O
, B-INCORRECT
was O
starving O
to O
death O
so B-INCORRECT
ate O
a O
lot O
. O

We O
made O
some O
incentives B-INCORRECT
about O
laws O
, O
but O
it B-INCORRECT
was O
a B-INCORRECT
total O
conflict O
because O
the O
group O
noticed O
that O
food O
missing O
somehow O
. O

I O
think O
that O
someone O
drags B-INCORRECT
some O
of O
the O
food O
on B-INCORRECT
night O
while O
everybody O
is B-INCORRECT
sleeping O
. O

So O
everybody O
is O
gon B-INCORRECT
na B-INCORRECT
try O
to O
enforce O
the O
laws O
. O

In B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
next O
morning O
I B-INCORRECT
ate O
a O
piece O
of O
steak O
and O
group O
was O
talking O
about O
some O
creatures O
that O
were O
walking O
around O
to B-INCORRECT
kill O
eat O
us O
. O

In O
the O
night O
I B-INCORRECT
was O
thinking O
about O
many O
things O
just B-INCORRECT
when O
heard O
some O
noises O
. O

I O
stalked O
him O
and O
it O
seemed O
that O
this O
guy O
has B-INCORRECT
a O
hump O
. O

I O
stomp B-INCORRECT
him O
and O
when O
he O
turned O
around O
it O
was O
a O
woman O
from O
the O
group O
. O

We O
were O
talking O
about O
this O
when B-INCORRECT
a O
dog O
just B-INCORRECT
came O
near O
; O
it O
was O
adorable O
he O
converted B-INCORRECT
into O
big O
weird O
creature O
. O

He O
bit O
my O
leg O
and O
it O
hurt O
a O
lot O
, B-INCORRECT
we B-INCORRECT
tried O
to O
alert O
the O
others O
but O
was O
too O
late O
group O
or O
us O
. O

We O
saw O
that O
beast O
eating O
our O
friends O
and O
the O
food O
. O

In O
some O
ways O
that B-INCORRECT
she O
robbed B-INCORRECT
the O
food O
in O
night O
and O
I O
wake B-INCORRECT
up O
it B-INCORRECT
was O
good O
for O
my O
survival O
. O

But O
if O
I B-INCORRECT
had O
the O
opportunity O
to O
reverse O
trend O
of O
how O
am B-INCORRECT
going O
would O
not O
do O
it O
because B-INCORRECT
have O
face O
all O
this O
. O

there O

to B-INCORRECT
public O

, B-INCORRECT
for B-INCORRECT
travelling O
by O

is O
much O
more O
convenient O
? O

Many O
disagree O
about O
the B-INCORRECT
public O

whom B-INCORRECT
are B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
be B-INCORRECT
disappearing B-INCORRECT
, O
though O
we O
still O
have O
deal O
with O
different O
opinions O
increasing B-INCORRECT
in O
travelling B-INCORRECT
. O

This O
composition O
will O
explain O
the O
two O
different O
opinions O
. O

Firstly O
, O
the O
car O
is O
more O
convenient O
because O
there O
privacy O
. O

Also O
, O
unlike O
public O
transport O
such O
as O
buses O
and O
underground B-INCORRECT
you O
have O
much O
more O
comfort O
speed O
. O

There O
is O
a O
perception O
that O
car O
can O
give O
you O
the B-INCORRECT
freedom O
of O
choice O
. O

Although O
they B-INCORRECT
are O
many O
positive O
points O
about O
private O
cars O
, O
also O
negative O
ones O
. O

Indeed O
, O
cars O
increases B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
pollution O
you O
have O
traffic O
congestion O
and O
it O
is O
very O
expensive O
. O
« B-INCORRECT

are O

Then O
just O
owning O
a O
car O
and O
looking O
after O
your O
, O
insurance O
tax O
etc O
. O

Obviously O
it B-INCORRECT
would O
benefit O
me O
if O
I O
worked O
in O

22 B-INCORRECT
years B-INCORRECT
old O
boy O
. O

Now O
, B-INCORRECT
secondly O
travelling O
by O
public O
transport O
is O
cheaper O
( O
we O
do O
n't O
pay O
any O
fees B-INCORRECT
on O
but O
also O
it O
safer O

According O
to B-INCORRECT
The O
Saigon O
Times O
, O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
traffic O
accidents O
which O
occurred B-INCORRECT
private O
cars O
. O

The O
main O
reason O
is O
that O
the O
cars O
' O
owners O
are O
drunk O
when O
driving O
. O

It O
is O
clear O
that O
if O
they B-INCORRECT
took O
a O
bus O
or O
taxi O
when O
were O
drank B-INCORRECT
, O
it B-INCORRECT
would O
not O
have B-INCORRECT
as O
much B-INCORRECT
accidents O
. O

Finally O
, O
many O
developed O
countries O
on B-INCORRECT
the O
world O
such O
as O
England O
America O
Canada O
Japan O
and O
so O
have O
built O
a O
public O
transport O
system O
traffic O
jam B-INCORRECT
been B-INCORRECT
decreased O
. O

As O
a O
result O
, O
the O
economy O
has O
been O
increasing O
. O

From O
this O
analysis O
, O
it O
isobvious B-INCORRECT
that O
travelling O
by O
public O

is O
very O
important O

" B-INCORRECT
Always O
telling O
the O
truth O
is O
considered O
most O
important O
thing O
in O
a O
relationship O
? B-INCORRECT

Disagreement O
on O
always O
telling O
the O
truth O
be B-INCORRECT
most O
important O
point B-INCORRECT
in O
a O
relationship O
will O
my O
opinion O
. O

Even O
though O
being O
truthful O
is O
crucial O
in O
relationship B-INCORRECT
, O
always O
telling O
the O
truth O
would B-INCORRECT
be O
considered O
as O
hurting O
others O
' O
feelings O
and O
unwise O
. O

Another O
reason O
for O
not O
telling O
the B-INCORRECT
truth O
all O
time O
is O
if O
it O
about O
personal B-INCORRECT
matter O
and O
would O
feel O
like B-INCORRECT
awkward O
to B-INCORRECT
mention O
colleagues O
or O
employer O
. O

It O
is O
better O
to O
tell O
a O
little O
white O
lie O
at O
this O
moment O
. O

To O
further O
illustrate O
the O
first O
point O
above O
, O
could B-INCORRECT
hurt O
one B-INCORRECT
's O
feelings O
by O
telling O
truth O
at O
all O
time B-INCORRECT
. O

For O
example O
, O
if O
some O
woman O
you O
are O
acquainted O
wearing B-INCORRECT
inappropriate O
clothes O
not O
fitting O
in B-INCORRECT
the O
occasion O
. O

People O
usually O
tend O
not O
telling B-INCORRECT
her O
the O
truth O
since B-INCORRECT
it O
could O
make B-INCORRECT
feelings O
. O

Instead O
of O
doing O
so O
, O
people O
may O
praise O
her O
with B-INCORRECT
other O
things O
on B-INCORRECT
. O

In O
that O
case O
, O
they O
could O
still O
make O
conversions B-INCORRECT
without O
boiling B-INCORRECT
her O
mood O
. O

The O
other O
point O
is O
when O
it B-INCORRECT
comes O
to O
personal O
matters O
, B-INCORRECT
people B-INCORRECT
usually O
intend B-INCORRECT
keep O
private O
since B-INCORRECT
most B-INCORRECT
of O
the O
time O
strange O
and O
inappropriate O
talk O
oneself B-INCORRECT
too O
much O
at O
work O
or O
even O
that O
one O
just B-INCORRECT
got O
acquainted O
. B-INCORRECT

If O
there O
are O
questions O
about O
things O
one O
do B-INCORRECT
not O
want O
other O
people O
to O
know O
, O
they O
might O
say B-INCORRECT
a O
little O
white O
lie O
which B-INCORRECT
usually O
does O
matter O
too O
much O
. O

If O
I O
was O
having O
a B-INCORRECT
day O
off O
to O
go O
doctor O
, B-INCORRECT
would O
prefer B-INCORRECT
other O
people O
from B-INCORRECT
asking O
details B-INCORRECT
about O
it O
by O
say B-INCORRECT
that O
just O
had O
some O
errands O
run O
. O

These O
are O
the B-INCORRECT
two O
opinions O
of O
mine O
on O
telling O
truth O
or O
not O
. O

Last O
Friday O
, O
Michael O
and O
I O
was B-INCORRECT
in B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
school O
playing O
happily O
with O
each O
other O
classroom O
. O

When O
we O
were O
in O
the O
class O
, O
suddenly O
Michael O
walked O
towards O
door O
. O

Michael O
closed O
the B-INCORRECT
door O
and O
knew O
at O
moment O
he O
made B-INCORRECT
a O
mistake O
. O

Due O
to O
this O
, O
we're B-INCORRECT
both O
called O
meet O
the O
headmaster O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
understood O
why O
we O
needed O
to O
meet O
the O
headmaster O
just O
because O
Michael O
had O
closed O
door O
. O

The O
door O
was O
n't O
broke B-INCORRECT
into O
pieces O
or O
fell B-INCORRECT
down O
. O

My O
curiosity O
had B-INCORRECT
put B-INCORRECT
me O
into O
a B-INCORRECT
big O
trouble O
. O

I O
asked O
the O
headmaster O
in O
a O
polite O
way O
and O
hopefully O
he O
can B-INCORRECT
gave B-INCORRECT
me O
answer O
wanted O
. O

However O
, O
things O
do B-INCORRECT
n't O
happened B-INCORRECT
like O
what B-INCORRECT
I O
hoped O
. O

I O
ended O
getting B-INCORRECT
expelled O
from O
the B-INCORRECT
school O
because O
teacher B-INCORRECT
and O
classmates O
suspected O
Michael O
steal B-INCORRECT
our O
classmate O
- B-INCORRECT
Sally O
's O
wallet O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
imagine B-INCORRECT
the O
teacher O
and O
friends B-INCORRECT
also B-INCORRECT
pointed O
at O
us B-INCORRECT
firmly O
without O
given B-INCORRECT
any O
chance O
for B-INCORRECT
to O
speak O
out O
. O

I O
finally O
realised O
that O
everything O
was O
a O
trap O
and O
we O
're B-INCORRECT
the O
unlucky O
innocent O
ones O
as O
fell O
into O
. O

We O
wiped O
off B-INCORRECT
our O
tears O
, O
and O
waved O
hands O
when O
we O
left O
the O
school O
. O

Although O
, O
one O
day O
later O
the O
headmaster O
found O
out O
truth O
through O
CCTV O
but B-INCORRECT
we O
refused O
to O
return O
school O
and O
decided O
change O
a B-INCORRECT
new O
as O
know O
even B-INCORRECT
if O
go O
back O
this O
time O
similar O
cases O
could O
happen O
next O
. O

This O
is O
because O
the O
teacher O
has O
a O
biased O
mindset O
. O

Dear O
USA O
summer O
camps O
, O

my O
name O
is O
Bianca O
Padovesi O
, O
and O
I O
have O
read O
your O
advertisement O
for O
the O
job O
. O

I O
consider B-INCORRECT
am O
the O
right O
person O
for O
this O
job O
because O
, O
firstly O
speak O
fluent O
and O
clear O
English O
which O
is O
very O
important O
to B-INCORRECT
communicate B-INCORRECT
. O

Also O
, B-INCORRECT
I O
have O
a O
good O
relation B-INCORRECT
with O
little O
kids O
use B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
look O
after O
my O
nieces O
and O
nephews O
over O
the O
weekends O
they O
love O
spending O
time O
me O
. O
moreover B-INCORRECT
am O
very O
energetic O
always O
awake O
ready O
work O
hard O

Furthermore O
, O
I O
am O
very O
creative O
and O
it O
is O
a O
good O
aspect O
of O
myself B-INCORRECT
as O
can O
invent O
new O
entertaining O
games O
for O
the O
kids O
to O
have O
great O
time O
. O

I O
like O
making O
puzzles O
or O
games O
which B-INCORRECT
imply B-INCORRECT
running O
, B-INCORRECT
jumping O
are O
important O
for O
the O
kids O
development B-INCORRECT
. O

I O
am O
not O
very O
good O
t B-INCORRECT
cooking O
but B-INCORRECT
because O
never O
have O
time B-INCORRECT
to O
dedicate O
on B-INCORRECT
that O
. O

I O
think O
that O
if O
watch B-INCORRECT
and O
learn B-INCORRECT
how O
to O
do O
it O
would O
very O
fast O
can B-INCORRECT
dominate B-INCORRECT
. O

That O
is O
a O
good O
quality O
of O
mine O
, B-INCORRECT
I O
learn O
thing B-INCORRECT
very O
fast O
and O
also B-INCORRECT
can B-INCORRECT
get O
used O
to O
new O
. O

I O
am O
very O
exited B-INCORRECT
about O
this O
job O
and O
hope O
you O
reply O
soon O
. O

We O
were O
ready O
to O
go O
and O
find O
the O
others O
, O
we O
went O
outside O
shelter O
built B-INCORRECT
write B-INCORRECT
in B-INCORRECT
wall O
near O
" O
safe O
zone O
if O
there O
is O
someone O
that O
needs O
supplies O
he O
would B-INCORRECT
some O
ammo O
survive O
. O

We O
start B-INCORRECT
our O
journey O
and O
going B-INCORRECT
in B-INCORRECT
the O
forest O
, B-INCORRECT
there B-INCORRECT
was B-INCORRECT
a O
lot O
of O
# B-INCORRECT
pests O
on B-INCORRECT
way O
were O
various O
guys O
that O
sick O
we B-INCORRECT
could O
n't O
do O
anything O
except O
for O
keep O
I O
seeing O
my O
little O
group O
to B-INCORRECT
diminish O
some O
us O
allergic O
plants O
only O
one O
had O
no O
problem B-INCORRECT
with O
all O
other O
stuff O
people O
problems O
. O

I B-INCORRECT
thought O
that O
maybe O
my O
# B-INCORRECT
genes O
were O
actually O
immune O
to O
the B-INCORRECT
infection O
could O
be O
revolutionary O
guy O
helps O
everyone O
was O
in O
skeptick O
and B-INCORRECT
really O
positive O
about O
it B-INCORRECT
but B-INCORRECT
notwithstanding O
, O
would O
n't O
sacrifice O
myself O
have O
think O
is B-INCORRECT
help O
entire O
world O
or O
just O
save O
a B-INCORRECT
group O
decision O
hands O
conventional O
do O
want O
die O
. O
while B-INCORRECT
thinking O
we B-INCORRECT
found O
body O
familiar O
from B-INCORRECT
someone O
one B-INCORRECT
of O
those O
guys O
wanted O
find O
alive O
not O
dead O
his B-INCORRECT
face O
all O
rotten O
eaten O
away O
by O
walkers O

We O
needed O
to O
find O
the B-INCORRECT
ones O
that O
were O
still O
alive O
or B-INCORRECT
at O
least O
tells B-INCORRECT
us O
what O
happened O
everyone B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
# O
battle O
against O
hunger O
started O
was O
hungry O
and B-INCORRECT
we O
haven't O
eaten O
anything O
in O
a O
few O
days O
could O
lead O
two O
things O
dead B-INCORRECT
away O
by O
walker O
so B-INCORRECT
something O
nutritional O
based B-INCORRECT
food O
where B-INCORRECT
eat O
with O
no O
problem B-INCORRECT
be O
ok B-INCORRECT
. O

We O
found O
a O
pharmacy O
and O
restroom O
where O
we O
could O
get B-INCORRECT
rest O
take O
shower O
to O
clean O
ourselves O
. O

We O
got O
close O
to O
the O
pharmacy O
there B-INCORRECT
was O
no O
walkers O
inside O
so B-INCORRECT
we O
run B-INCORRECT
into O
and O
closed O
all O
doors O
I B-INCORRECT
someone O
check O
us B-INCORRECT
in O
night O
needed O
some O
rest O
went O
sleep O
immediately O
. O

In O
my O
area O
there O
are O
many O
railway O
lines B-INCORRECT
and O
they O
're O
often O
overcrowded O
. O

But O
private O
traffic O
in O
this O
town O
is O
yet O
more O
present O
, O
as O
the B-INCORRECT
result O
that B-INCORRECT
Turin O
of O
FIAT O
well O
known O
factory O
. O

Near O
to O
your O
home O
, O
there O
are O
many O
supermarkets O
in O
which O
you O
can O
easily O
buy O
all O
that O
need O
live O
. O

When O
you O
have O
to O
pay O
the O
telephone O
and O
energy O
bills O
, O
can O
do O
that O
in O
any O
tobacco O
shops B-INCORRECT
near O
your O
home O
. O

If O
you O
like O
shopping O
, O
in O
the O
perimeter B-INCORRECT
of O
town O
there O
are O
some O
big O
supermarkets O
which O
hold O
many O
items O
main O
great O
factories O
Europe O
and O
above B-INCORRECT
. O

Like B-INCORRECT
all O
the B-INCORRECT
industrialised O
countries O
, O
a O
connection O
to O
Internet O
is O
granted B-INCORRECT
almost O
for O
each O
area O
and O
building O
. O

At B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
end B-INCORRECT
, O
taxi B-INCORRECT
are O
present B-INCORRECT
and O
they O
cover O
all O
town O
but O
this O
service O
is O
less O
organised O
developed O
than O
English O
one O
. O

There O
is O
an O
opinion O
that O
famous O
people O
, O
such O
as O
celebrities O
film O
stars O
politicians O
or O
who O
work O
in O
music B-INCORRECT
industry O
deserve O
to O
have O
a O
private O
life O
not O
be O
under O
constant O
observation O
. O

To O
my O
mind O
there B-INCORRECT
should O
be O
a B-INCORRECT
board B-INCORRECT
between O
paparazzi O
work O
and O
privacy O
of O
famous O
people O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
big B-INCORRECT
stars O
should O
be O
able O
to O
relax O
and O
take B-INCORRECT
some O
private O
time O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I O
'm O
concerned O
there B-INCORRECT
is B-INCORRECT
no O
one O
who O
feels O
comfortable O
when O
under O
surveillance O
of O
people O
wait O
to O
take O
pictures O
which O
shows B-INCORRECT
them O
in O
embarrassing B-INCORRECT
situation O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
this O
is O
a O
part O
of O
celeb B-INCORRECT
's B-INCORRECT
' O
work O
so B-INCORRECT
they O
have O
to O
take O
into B-INCORRECT
account O
. O

But O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
there O
should O
be O
some O
inviolability B-INCORRECT
spheres O
of O
life O
without O
journalists O
following O
them O
all O
time O
. O

This B-INCORRECT
rarely B-INCORRECT
fragments O
of O
life O
without O
an B-INCORRECT
eye O
a O
camera O
should O
be O
opportunity O
to O
live O
like O
normal O
, O
not B-INCORRECT
famous O
people O
. O

I O
know O
that O
catching O
celebrity B-INCORRECT
doing O
celaning B-INCORRECT
or O
taking O
a B-INCORRECT
dog O
for O
walk O
is O
shocking O
news O
people O
who O
read O
tabloids O
. O

To O
my O
mind O
, O
they O
do O
not O
believe O
celebs B-INCORRECT
are O
such B-INCORRECT
a B-INCORRECT
normal O
people O
as B-INCORRECT
everyone O
of O
us O
only B-INCORRECT
with O
more O
money O
in O
theirs B-INCORRECT
bank O
accounts O

So O
, O
as O
you O
can O
see O
I B-INCORRECT
agree O
with O
the O
statement O
that O
famous O
people O
who O
are O
recognizable O
deserve O
to O
have O
a O
privte B-INCORRECT
life O
and O
ability O
of B-INCORRECT
having B-INCORRECT
normal B-INCORRECT
should O
be B-INCORRECT
also B-INCORRECT
given O
them O
. O

The O
Maze O
Runner O

I O
recently O
watched O
this O
new O
film O
based O
on O
one O
of B-INCORRECT
the O
books O
worldwide B-INCORRECT
known B-INCORRECT
author O
. O

As O
I O
have O
an O
interest O
in O
thrillers O
, O
decided O
to O
give O
it O
a O
try O
. O

The O
poster O
of O
the O
film O
already O
offered O
a O
sense O
intrigue O
and O
mystery O
which B-INCORRECT
made O
me O
take O
decision O
to O
watch O
this O
. O

The O
film O
starts O
by O
putting O
yourself B-INCORRECT
in O
the O
flesh O
of O
main O
character O
, O
which B-INCORRECT
is O
a O
16-year O
- O
old O
boy O
who O
finds O
himself O
imprisoned O
cage O
and O
being O
transported O
to O
what O
it B-INCORRECT
seems O
be O
camp O
. O

He O
has O
no O
idea O
how O
he O
ended O
up O
there O
. O

However O
, O
he O
soon O
realizes O
that O
this O
is O
not O
a O
normal O
camp O
which B-INCORRECT
located O
next O
to O
giant O
and O
mysterious O
maze O
. O

The O
people O
who O
lives B-INCORRECT
in O
the O
camp O
take O
up O
different O
roles O
order O
to O
survive O
and O
defend O
themselves O
from B-INCORRECT
menaces O
of O
maze O
. O

He O
took O
the O
role O
of B-INCORRECT
a B-INCORRECT
runner O
, O
people O
responsible O
for O
exploring O
maze O
and O
look B-INCORRECT
an O
exit O
this O
place O
. O

Still O
, O
they O
only O
have B-INCORRECT
the O
daylight O
time O
to O
explore O
maze O
as O
when O
sun O
goes O
down O
it B-INCORRECT
becomes O
very O
dangerous O
. O

The O
film O
keeps O
getting O
better O
and O
as O
you O
watch O
it O
, O
having O
its O
exciting O
moments O
when O
the O
characters O
discover O
something O
that O
hidden B-INCORRECT
inside O
maze O
. O

I O
heartily O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
who O
wants O
have O
a O
rush O
of O
adrenaline O
while O
enjoying O
solid O
story O
which O
will O
leave O
no O
one O
indifferent O
. O

I O
've O
been O
playing O
volleyball O
for O
12 O
years O
now O
and O
hopefully O
many B-INCORRECT
more O
, B-INCORRECT
what B-INCORRECT
love O
about O
it O
is B-INCORRECT
first B-INCORRECT
of O
all O
that B-INCORRECT
tall B-INCORRECT
or O
small O
anyone O
could B-INCORRECT
play O
as O
long B-INCORRECT
they O
're O
determined O
so B-INCORRECT
basically O
a O
life O
sport O
everyone O
. O

I O
love O
the O
speed O
of O
volleyball O
, B-INCORRECT
most B-INCORRECT
time O
it O
's O
quick O
and B-INCORRECT
if B-INCORRECT
you B-INCORRECT
blink O
probably B-INCORRECT
missed B-INCORRECT
something O
each B-INCORRECT
contact O
happens O
in O
less O
than O
a O
second O
still O
every O
player O
directs B-INCORRECT
location O
ball O
that O
amount O
then O
there O
intensity O
haven't O
seen O
game O
go B-INCORRECT
until O
32 O
- O
30 O
see O
energy O
on O
floor O
hear O
noise O
from O
crowd O
're O
missing O
out O
. O

Personally O
winning B-INCORRECT
such O
a O
set O
makes O
me O
feel O
like O
I O
could O
do O
anything O
, O
but O
when O
n't O
it O
still O
keeps O
wanting O
more O
. O

I O
am O
always O
trying O
to O
jump O
higher O
, O
hit O
harder O
pass O
and O
set O
better O
serve O
in O
more O
different O
ways O
. O

I O
live O
in O
New O
Eltham O
. O

My O
area O
is O
very O
clean O
and O
green O
. O

People O
there O
are O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful O
. O

It O
is O
a O
good O
place O
to O
live O
. O

One B-INCORRECT
time B-INCORRECT
per O
week O
on O
Wednesday O
, O
robbish B-INCORRECT
are B-INCORRECT
taken B-INCORRECT
. O

Of O
course O
garbage B-INCORRECT
is O
sorted O
into O
different O
bins O
. O

That O
is O
very B-INCORRECT
good O
idea O
, O
because O
that O
robbish B-INCORRECT
undergo B-INCORRECT
a B-INCORRECT
recycling O
. O

All O
my O
neighbors O
in B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
same B-INCORRECT
way B-INCORRECT
collected B-INCORRECT
garbage B-INCORRECT
. O

Every B-INCORRECT
body B-INCORRECT
care B-INCORRECT
about O
cleanlinees B-INCORRECT
in O
the B-INCORRECT
front O
of O
house O
and O
garden O
. O

Especially O
spring B-INCORRECT
is B-INCORRECT
a O
lot O
of O
colours O
and O
pleasant O
odors O
. O

New O
Eltham O
have B-INCORRECT
beautiful O
parks O
where O
you O
can O
relax O
from O
the O
busy O
place O
. O

Green O
time O
in O
my O
town O
is O
really O
fantastic O
. O

I O
have O
recently O
eaten O
at O
Black O
Bear O
restaurant O
, O
a O
typical O
Sicilian O
in O
Trecastagni O
little O
town O
near O
Catania O
located O
under O
the O
Etna O
volcano O
slopes O
and O
found O
that O
was O
easily O
best O
. O

There O
were O
two O
rooms O
, O
smoking B-INCORRECT
room O
or B-INCORRECT
non B-INCORRECT
- O
. O

The O
surroundings O
were O
rustic O
, B-INCORRECT
yet O
it O
still O
felt O
airy O
and O
cosy O
the B-INCORRECT
waiters O
very O
friendly O
informative O
. O

As O
I O
was O
eaten B-INCORRECT
with O
my O
friend O
Moreno B-INCORRECT
and B-INCORRECT
his O
father O
, B-INCORRECT
managed O
to O
sample O
a O
good O
range O
of O
items O
on O
the O
menu O
really O
liked O
Chianina B-INCORRECT
beef O
it B-INCORRECT
very O
tasty O
. O

All O
the O
ingredients O
were O
clearly O
fresh O
and O
of O
highest O
quality O
. O

The O
price O
was O
n't O
reasonable O
at O
all O
, O
because O
the O
meal O
came O
to O
about O
forty O
euros O
per O
person O
so O
this O
restaurant O
it B-INCORRECT
's B-INCORRECT
a O
little O
expensive O
. O

But O
I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
restaurant O
despite B-INCORRECT
the O
fact O
that O
meal O
was O
a O
little O
expensive O
and B-INCORRECT
will O
no B-INCORRECT
doubt O
be B-INCORRECT
back O
for O
other O
dinners B-INCORRECT
. O

Drugs O
is O
a O
topic O
with O
lot O
of O
controversy O
. O

They O
have O
been O
present O
in O
our O
societies O
since B-INCORRECT
ever O
. O

Cannabis O
, O
heroin O
speed O
are O
some O
examples O
of O
substances O
that O
really O
well O
- O
known O
for B-INCORRECT
all O
us O
. O

Legalization O
of O
drugs O
is O
a B-INCORRECT
very B-INCORRECT
used B-INCORRECT
argument O
by O
people O
who O
believe O
that O
this O
measure O
could O
solve O
the B-INCORRECT
problem O
exclusion O
. O

Margination B-INCORRECT
has O
a O
link O
with O
the O
illegality O
of O
this O
activity O
. O

Also O
this B-INCORRECT
illegality O
is O
the B-INCORRECT
guilty B-INCORRECT
for O
attraction O
of O
drugs O
because O
majority O
people O
start O
having B-INCORRECT
they O
are O
young O
and O
its O
prohibition O
very O
stimulating O
. O

The O
real O
problem O
comes O
when O
this O
entertainment O
become B-INCORRECT
in B-INCORRECT
an O
addiction O
that O
can O
destroy O
our O
lives O
. O

I O
think O
everyone O
has O
proved B-INCORRECT
some O
kind O
of O
illegal O
drug O
to O
have O
fun O
, O
enjoy O
friends B-INCORRECT
or O
just O
prove B-INCORRECT
them O
and O
do O
not O
believe O
that O
behaviour O
is O
wrong O
because B-INCORRECT
needs O
experiment O
try O
new O
things O
. O

But O
we O
have B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
be O
responsible O
and O
very O
clear O
that O
it O
is O
only O
something O
exceptional O
not O
our O
daily O
life O
because B-INCORRECT
dangerous O
as O
some O
people O
are O
able O
put B-INCORRECT
deadlines B-INCORRECT
themselves O
. O

Finally O
, O
legalization O
of O
drugs O
means O
that O
they O
could O
be O
taxable O
and O
we O
know O
how O
the O
taxes O
work O
in O
our O
country O
so B-INCORRECT
I O
do O
not O
if O
it O
is O
a O
good O
idea O
or O
. O

Hi O
Shrooq O
, O

That O
sounds O
great O
, B-INCORRECT
I O
'm O
so O
happy O
to O
hear O
that O
you O
are O
coming O
Saudi O
Arabia O

Dear O
Les O
, O

Firstly B-INCORRECT
, O
Spain O
is O
a O
great O
place O
for O
holidays O
in O
summer O
. O

In B-INCORRECT
that O
time O
, O
it O
is O
always O
sunny O
and O
depending O
on O
the O
region O
could O
rain O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
see O
some O
beautiful O
scenery O
, O
must O
go O
Barcelona O
where O
will O
be O
able O
La O
Sagrada O
Familia O
which O
was O
built O
by O
Antoni O
Gaudi O
or O
Alambra O
in O
Granada O
is O
one O
of O
the O
Seven O
Wonders O
World O
. O

In O
Madrid O
you O
can O
go O
to O
visit O
some O
museums O
, O
like O
the O
Reina O
Sofía O
or O
El O
Prado O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, B-INCORRECT
if O
you B-INCORRECT
want O
to O
see O
some O
wildlife O
must O
visit O
Cabarcenos O
National O
Park O
in O
Cantabria O
what B-INCORRECT
is O
like O
a O
little O
safari O
or O
Doñana O
which B-INCORRECT
that O
period O
can O
migration B-INCORRECT

. O

If O
I O
were O
you O
and O
had O
a O
completely B-INCORRECT
summer O
to O
enjoy O
Spain O
, O
would O
stay O
one O
week O
in O
each O
place O

car O
order O
move B-INCORRECT
between O
the O
cities O
. O

I O
hope O
you O

your O
summer O
. O

Adrián O
. O

Bart O
Simpson O
is O
my O
favourite O
fictional O
character O
on O
TV O
. O

He O
is O
the O
eldest O
son O
of O
Simpson O
family O
. O

Bart O
is O
ten O
years O
old O
and O
a O
typical O
American O
child O
. O

He O
has O
yellow O
skin O
and O
big O
eyes O
, B-INCORRECT
he B-INCORRECT
is O
blond O
gotspiky B-INCORRECT
hair O
. O

Bart O
always O
wears O
a O
red O
T O
- O
shirt O
and O
blue O
shorts O
. O

The O
most O
important O
thing O
for B-INCORRECT
Bart O
is O
to O
be O
the O
popular O
student O
in O
his O
school O
, B-INCORRECT
this O
reason O
he O
always O
misbehaving O
. O

His O
parents O
and O
the O
school O
principal O
often O
punish O
him O
. O

Bart O
is O
energetic B-INCORRECT
and O
clever O
student O
but O
he O
also O
a O
bad O
hates O
nerds O
. O

Although O
he O
is O
rather O
naughty O
, O
has B-INCORRECT
actually B-INCORRECT
a O
heart O
of O
gold O
because O
helps O
his O
sister O
when O
she O
needs O
him O
. O

In O
the O
Simpson O
family O
all B-INCORRECT
characters O
are O
very O
funny O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
magazines O
say O
The O
Simpsons O
is O
the O
best O
cartoon O
series O
in O
history O
and O
I O
absolutely O
agree O
. O

For O
me O
, O
Bart O
is O
funnier O
than O
Homer O
although O
most O
magazines O
say O
that O
the O
best O
character O

It O
was O
one O
dreary O
rainy B-INCORRECT
Sunday O
morning O
. O

I O
was O
n't O
in O
the O
mood O
to O
go O
out O
anyway O
. O

Everything O
suggested O
that O
I O
wo B-INCORRECT
n't O
get O
out O
of O
the O
house O
for O
quite O
a O
while O
. O

Suddenly O
, O
there O
was O
a O
heavy O
knock O
on O
the O
door O
. O

Who O
on O
Earth O
could O
that O
be O
? O

Who O
would O
have O
even O
bothered O
to O
pay O
me O
a O
visit O
during O
this O
bloody O
awful O
weather O
? O

My O
concerns O
were O
answered O
swiftly O
, O
for O
the O
man O
on O
my O
threshold O
yelled O
: O
" O
I O
have O
a O
letter O
Mr. O
Samson O
! O

" O
I O
was O
quite O
surprised O
, B-INCORRECT
to O
be O
honest O
had O
n't O
received O
a O
letter O
for O
months O
. O

I O
opened O
it O
and O
quickly O
scanned O
the O
text O
. O

At O
first O
, O
I O
had O
observed O
the O
letter O
cautiously O
but O
then O
noticed O
my O
uncle O
's O
name O
in B-INCORRECT
it O
. O

Although O
, B-INCORRECT
I O
had O
n't O
met O
him O
a O
single O
time O
this O
letter O
was O
his O
last O
will O
and O
learned O
that O
inherited B-INCORRECT
good O
deal O
of O
money O
. O

Fifty O
thousand O
pounds O
, O
to O
be O
precise O
. O

Exultation O
seized O
my O
mind O
instantly O
, O
but O
I O
soon O
began O
to O
worry O
: O
" O
What O
will O
do O
with O
this O
amount O
of O
money O
? O

Well O
, O
the O
task O
I O
have O
chosen O
is O
about O
town O
where O
been O
staying B-INCORRECT
for O
last B-INCORRECT
ten O
years O
. O

Actually O
, O
this O
town O
is O
located O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
hills O
and O
a O
river O
without O
water O
. O

I O
am O
very O
much B-INCORRECT
worried O
about O
the O
town O
where O
staying B-INCORRECT
because O
everybody O
of B-INCORRECT
this O
is O
not O
bother B-INCORRECT
rubbish B-INCORRECT
things O
they O
do O
every O
day O
. O

First O
of O
all O
they B-INCORRECT
are O
very O
dirty O
by O
nature O
. O

they B-INCORRECT
are O
very O
casual O
with B-INCORRECT
the O
environment O
and O
importance O
of O
cleanliness O
. O

So O
called B-INCORRECT
people O
of B-INCORRECT
good O
nature O
are O
inactive O
and O
talkative O
gossip O
others O
not B-INCORRECT
doing O
anything O
for O
the O
betterment B-INCORRECT
their O
own O
town O
. O

All O
the B-INCORRECT
household B-INCORRECT
nearby O
public O
road O
throws B-INCORRECT
dirty O
things O
easily B-INCORRECT
and O
even B-INCORRECT
do B-INCORRECT
n't B-INCORRECT
bother O
about O
order O
of O
municipality O
. O

I O
see O
all O
these B-INCORRECT
during O
my O
morning O
walk O
. O

what B-INCORRECT
I O
feel O
is O
that O
everyone O
who O
are B-INCORRECT
staying B-INCORRECT
the O
town O
should O
at O
least O
keep O
clean O
their O
own O
front O
places O
and O
sides O
surrounds O
them O
. O

I B-INCORRECT
am O
upset O
about O
it O
and O
whenever B-INCORRECT
get O
a O
chance O
speak O
with O
my O
fellow O
people B-INCORRECT
look O
for O
their O
feedback O
but B-INCORRECT
they O
are O
also O
the O
same O
in O
nature O
. O

People O
are B-INCORRECT
now B-INCORRECT
self O
- O
centred O
and O
very O
narrow O
minded B-INCORRECT
. O

Though O
they O
are O
becoming O
so O
called B-INCORRECT
educated O
but B-INCORRECT
in O
real B-INCORRECT
sense O
still O
savage B-INCORRECT
. O

Luisa O

Nowadays O
, O
public O
transport O
has O
become O
a O
major O
topic O
. O

The O
idea O
of O
leaving B-INCORRECT
public B-INCORRECT
transportation B-INCORRECT
aside B-INCORRECT
is O
widely O
supported O
in O
developed O
countries O
, O
but O
this O
rejected O
developing O
like O
the O
one O
I O
live O
. O

As O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
car O
ownership O
have B-INCORRECT
increased O
over O
the O
last O
decades O
reducing B-INCORRECT
amount B-INCORRECT
people O
using O
public O
transport O
. O

The O
possibility O
of O
travelling O
in O
their O
own O
cars O
is O
much O
more O
convenient O
than O
going B-INCORRECT
by B-INCORRECT
a O
bus O
full O
people O
or O
even B-INCORRECT
worse O
, O
the O
idea O
wasting O
time O
long O
queue O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
you B-INCORRECT
have B-INCORRECT
another O
side O
to O
this O
reality O
. O

There O
are O
people O
who O
can O
not O
afford O
to O
have O
their O
own O
cars O
or O
maybe O
they O
travel O
by O
any O
other O
means O
of O
transportation O
than O
the O
ones O
provided O
local O
government O
. O

There O
are O
countries O
where O
gas O
is O
so O
expensive O
that O
people O
choose O
to O
pay O
the O
bus O
fee B-INCORRECT
rather O
than O
paying B-INCORRECT
for O
a O
full O
tank O
. O

Similarly O
, O
people O
in O
countries O
with O
less B-INCORRECT
income O
turn O
to O
these O
services O
because O
it O
is O
a O
way O
reduce O
their O
overall O
expenses O
. O

To O
conclude O
, O
the O
future O
of O
public O
transport O
will O
depend O
on O
usage O
people O
give B-INCORRECT
it O
. O

There O
will O
be O
countries O
in B-INCORRECT
which O
there O
no O
need O
for O
it O
, O
and O
others O
where O
they O
as O
long O
their O
economy O
needs O
. O

People O
need O
easy O
, O
fast O
and O
cheap O
solutions O
. O

In O
general O
, O
using O
a O
car O
is O
easier O
then O
taking O
train O
or O
bus O
. O

It O
's O
just O
near O
your O
house O
or O
office O
. O

You O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
go O
a O
station O
by B-INCORRECT
walking B-INCORRECT
, O
carrying O
weights B-INCORRECT
or O
suffering O
because O
of O
the O
rain O
snow O
. O

But O
if O
you B-INCORRECT
are O
sleepy O
, O
tired O
bored O
or O
simply B-INCORRECT
do O
n't O
like O
to O
drive O
can B-INCORRECT
find O
easier B-INCORRECT
take O
a B-INCORRECT
public O
transport O
. O

And O
also O
more O
enjoyable O
: O
you O
can O
relax O
listening B-INCORRECT
to O
the B-INCORRECT
music O
and O
looking O
around O
, O
or O
reading O
newspapers O
books O
. O

Is O
the O
car O
faster O
then B-INCORRECT
public O
transport O
? O

It O
depends O
. O

The O
traffic O
can O
affect O
cars O
and O
buses O
at B-INCORRECT
the O
same O
level B-INCORRECT
. O

Sometimes O
cars O
are O
faster O
then B-INCORRECT
buses O
, B-INCORRECT
sometimes O
. O

Speed B-INCORRECT
trains O
are O
always O
faster O
then B-INCORRECT
cars O
. O

Speaking O
about O
money O
? B-INCORRECT
Travelling B-INCORRECT
by O
car O
seems O
cheaper O
than O
public O
transport O
. O

But O
, O
if O
we O
consider O
all O
the B-INCORRECT
expenses O
( O
buying O
car O
paying O
insurance O
etc O
. O
) O
maybe O
cars O
are O
not O
so O
cheap O

In O
fact O
, O
in O
every O
aspect O
there O
are O
pros O
and O
cons O
. O

What O
about O
the O
environment O
and O
quality O
of O
life O
in O
cities O
? O

Public O
transport O
is O
absolutely B-INCORRECT
better O
. O

So O
, O
even O
if O
travelling O
by O
car O
can O
be O
more O
convenient O
at O
a O
personal O
level O
public O
transport O
has B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
preferred O
good O
citizens O
and O
strongly O
supported O
governments O
. O

Informal O
letter O
for O
CAE O
( O
PART O
1 O
) O

Dear O
Jan O
, O

Thank O
you O
for O
your O
letter O
. O

I O
am O
delighted O
to O
hear O
you O
are O
thinking O
about O
working O
in O
the O
summer O
. O

From O
my O
experience O
working O
at O
the B-INCORRECT
International B-INCORRECT
company O
that O
organises O
music O
festivals O
, O
I O
can O
assure O
you O
it O
will O
be O
of O
great O
use O
to O
. O

I O
am O
not O
sure O
, O
however O
that B-INCORRECT
this O
job O
will O
meet O
all O
your O
requirements O
. B-INCORRECT

In O
my O
case O
, O
the O
only O
opportunity O
I O
got O
for B-INCORRECT
such O
activity O
was O
on O
22nd O
of O
July O
when O
they O
allowed O
a O
relaxing O
day O
at O
festival O
. O

Happily O
you B-INCORRECT
will O
get O
the O
chance O
to O
practise O
your O
English O
skills O
. O

In O
my O
case O
, O
I O
had O
to O
translate O
a O
good B-INCORRECT
amount O
of O
texts O
and O
also O
help O
English O
tourists O
get O
around O
. O

Though B-INCORRECT
if B-INCORRECT
you B-INCORRECT
are B-INCORRECT
looking B-INCORRECT
for B-INCORRECT
additional B-INCORRECT
work B-INCORRECT
experience B-INCORRECT
will O
probably O
be O
disappointed O
. O

All O
I O
was O
asked O
to O
do O
in B-INCORRECT
the O
rest O
of O
time O
take O
phone O
calls O
and O
make O
coffee O
for O
tourists O
. O

All O
in O
all O
, O
the O
experience O
was O
beneficial O
. O

I O
made O
plenty O
of O
money O
, O
so O
would O
n't O
worry O
about O
having O
enough O
for O
a O
nice O
holiday O
if O
were O
you O
. O

When O
you O
decide O
what O
to O
do O
, O
not O
hesitate O
let O
me O
know O
! O

Take O
care O
of O
yourself O
, O

Favius O

The O
past O
few O
weeks O
have O
been O
really O
tough O
for O
Michael O
. O

This O
whole O
business O
started B-INCORRECT
to O
get O
on O
his O
nerves O
. O

He O
has O
to O
deal O
with O
it O
, O
the O
sooner O
better O
. O

For O
now O
one B-INCORRECT
thing O
is O
clear O
as O
day O
- O
the O
he O
in O
love O
with O
Malika O
, O
not O
Angelina O
. O

The O
one O
he O
dates O
is O
Angelina O
, B-INCORRECT
not O
Malika O
that B-INCORRECT
's O
the O
problem O
. O

He O
ca O
n't O
dump O
Angy O
just O
like O
that O
, O
they O
've O
been O
friends O
for O
years O
. O

She O
's O
not O
bad O
. O

And O
he O
has O
to O
put O
stop B-INCORRECT
this O
without O
hurting O
anybody O
. O

So O
yes B-INCORRECT
, O
the O
decision O
is O
made O
. O

He O
'll O
break O
up O
with O
her O
. O

Probably O
, O
even O
tomorrow O
. O

It O
all O
started O
in O
such O
an O
idiotic O
way O
. O

The O
door O
of O
his O
room O
was O
opened B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
he B-INCORRECT
came O
out O
the O
bathroom O
with O
just O
a O
towel O
around O
waist O
and O
Angelina O
happened O
to O
pop O
in O
borrow O
lighter O
or O
matches O
something O
light O
up B-INCORRECT
cigarette O
. O

Mike O
ca O
n't O
really O
say O
why O
they O
ended O
up O
having O
sex O
- O
perhaps O
, O
at O
the O
time O
he O
was O
pissed O
himself O
for O
not O
balls B-INCORRECT
to O
get O
girl O
loved O

knew O
had O
made O
a O
huge O
mistake O

XYZ O

Well O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
talk O
about O
my O
school O
life O
. O

I O
'm O
seventeen O
years O
old O
and O
an O
electonics B-INCORRECT
' B-INCORRECT
student O
from O
Italy O
, O
in O
the O
north O
. O

I O
wish B-INCORRECT
to O
be O
a O
great O
engineer O
one O
day O
so B-INCORRECT
've O
decided O
continue O
my O
studies O
at O
university O
. O

I O
'm O
good O
at O
school O
, O
my O
marks O
could B-INCORRECT
prove O
it O
; O
have O
worked O
hard O
since O
the O
beginning O
of O
year O
. O

These B-INCORRECT
days B-INCORRECT
I O
started O
studyng B-INCORRECT
English O
in O
particular O
because O
it O
is O
the O
most O
important O
language O
world O
, O
so O
need O
to O
know O
well O
if O
want O
communicate O
with O
other O
people O
from O
countries O
. O

School O
is O
my O
life O
: O
I O
study O
about O
seven O
hours O
a O
day O
, O
especially O
maths O
and O
electronics O
that B-INCORRECT
are O
the O
subjects O
like O
more B-INCORRECT
. O

My O
teachers O
are O
very O
good O
at O
their O
job O
so B-INCORRECT
I O
hope O
to O
be O
like O
them O
one O
day O
. O

The O
big O
problem O
in O
my O
class O
are B-INCORRECT
the O
majority O
of O
classmates O
: O
they O
hopeful O
at O
school O
and O
waste O
time O
doing O
nothing O
I B-INCORRECT
think O
even B-INCORRECT
home O
. O

The O
thing O
that O
more B-INCORRECT
annoys O
me B-INCORRECT
is O
they O
copy O
all B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
time B-INCORRECT
from B-INCORRECT
and B-INCORRECT
other B-INCORRECT
good B-INCORRECT
students B-INCORRECT
. O

However O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
hate O
them O
at O
all O
; O
they O
are O
very O
funny O
and O
kind O
people O
when O
want O
. O

Coming O
back O
to O
my O
dream O
, O
I O
would O
like O
carry O
on O
with O
studies O
in O
London O
at O
the B-INCORRECT
Imperial O
college O
. O

I O
hope O
to O
be O
at B-INCORRECT
a O
good O
English O
level O
because B-INCORRECT
next O
year O
am O
going O
take O
the O
intermediate O
certificate O
of O
and O
then O
try O
enter B-INCORRECT
this O
school O
even B-INCORRECT
if B-INCORRECT
know O
that O
it O
's O
very O
difficult O
; O
Imperial O
college O
London O
is O
one O
most O
important O
universities O
in O
whole O
world O
. O

Puerquitour O
: O
A O
great O
experience O
to B-INCORRECT
your O
mouth O
. O

Nowadays O
it B-INCORRECT
is O
difficult O
to O
find O
people O
who O
enjoy O
the B-INCORRECT
food O
as O
much O
I O
do O
, O
because O
calories O
kilos O
they O
are O
going O
gain O
and B-INCORRECT
all O
that O
stuff O
. O

I O
arrived O
at B-INCORRECT
Mexico O
City O
one O
month O
ago O
and O
met O
an O
old O
friend O
from O
high O
school O
, O
Vicente O
. O

We O
discovered O
our O
fascination O
with O
food O
and O
' O
The O
Puerquitour O
was O
born O
. O

Then O
a O
brainstorm O
about O
meals O
and O
places O
to O
visit O
began O
. O

The O
first O
day O
started O
in B-INCORRECT
an O
important O
date O
… O
Taco O
Day O
! O

Tacontento O
was O
the O
place O
we O
choose B-INCORRECT
and O
really O
enjoyed O
alambre O
al O
pastor O
grilled O
onions O
, O
accompanied O
by O
cold O
beers O
. O

Due B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
Puerquitour O
is O
something O
share O
, O
the O
second O
day O
we O
shared O
it O
with O
Diana O
one O
of O
my O
friends O
from O
Vancouver O
. O

Again O
we B-INCORRECT
ate O
tacos O
, O
but O
this O
time O
they O
were O
special O
. O

The O
name O
of O
the O
place O
is O
Tacos O
La O
Chule O
and O
tacos O
are O
gourmet O
there O
. O

It B-INCORRECT
means O
that O
they O

different O
taste B-INCORRECT

strawberry O
chipotle O
nopal O
and O
walnut O
among O
others- O
salsas O
-tamarind O

That O
day O
did O
not O

tacos O
, B-INCORRECT
after B-INCORRECT
a O
walk O
in O

just O
too O
much O

Do O
n't O

Almost O
a O
week O
in B-INCORRECT
the O
Puerquitour O
. O

The O
sixth O

was O
to O
celebrate O
Magda B-INCORRECT

really O
nice O
breakfast O

gourmet O
sandwiches O
and O

. O

Then O

. O

I O
love O
to O
spend O
time O
doing O
what O
like O
and O
with O
people O
. O

Do O
n't O
forget O
to O

and O
enjoy O
Puerquitour O

These O
first O
two O
chapters O
extracted O
from O
Great O
Expectations O
by O
Charles O
Dickens O
introduce O
a O
young O
boy O
known O
as O
Pip O
. O

This O
kid B-INCORRECT
has O
been O
raised O
by O
his B-INCORRECT
sister O
, O
a O
person O
who O
mistreats O
Pip O
and O
own O
husband O
. O

Sadly O
, O
Pip O
has O
no O
fortune O
in B-INCORRECT
any B-INCORRECT
possible B-INCORRECT
way B-INCORRECT
. O

Moreover O
, O
he O
is O
just O
a O
regular O
kid B-INCORRECT
with O
terrible O
life O
. O

Beside B-INCORRECT
this O
, O
Pip O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
shy O
and O
intelligent O
kid B-INCORRECT
. O

He O
does O
not O
use O
complex O
words O
when O
he O
talks O
, O
but O
uses O
them O
narrates O
. O

Also O
, O
his O
life O
would O
be O
perfect O
to O
create O
a O
dark O
comedy O
based O
on O
the O
undesirable O
of O
kid B-INCORRECT
who O
only O
feels O
comfortable O
when O
he O
visits O
tombstones O
parents O
. O

Obviously O
, O
nobody O
would O
like O
to O
live O
his O
life O
but O
I O
think O
everyone O
tend O
feel O
sadness O
reading O
these O
chapters O
and O
finally B-INCORRECT
him O
. O

At O
least O
, O
I O
feel O
sorry O
for O
him O
and O
would O
like O
to O
find O
that O
his O
story O
has O
a O
good O
ending O
. O

He O
looks O
like O
a O
good O
boy O
that O
lives O
in O
hell O
and O
the O
Devil O
is O
his O
sister O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
narrator O
is O
truly B-INCORRECT
protagonist O
and O
way O
to B-INCORRECT
tell B-INCORRECT
actions B-INCORRECT
reason O
why O
story O
can O
connect O
with O
reader O
. O

Actually O
, O
the O
narrator O
is O
our O
protagonist O
but O
telling O
story O
as O
an O
adult O
. O

And O
the O
author O
does O
not O
try O
to O
describe O
protagonist O
with O
words O
, O
but O
actions O
. O

The O
narrator O
did O
not O
use O
any O
description O
of O
the O
protagonist O
apart O
from O
his O
name O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
narrator O
mainly O
uses O
direct O
speech O
but O
he O
only O
indirect O
in B-INCORRECT
just O
a O
few O
occasions O
referring B-INCORRECT
to O
his O
own O
words O
. O

This O
exception O
can O
be O
read O
at O
the O
end O
of O
first O
chapter O
, O
where O
narrator O
answer B-INCORRECT
thief O
writing B-INCORRECT
that O
he O
said O
would O
get O
him O
file O
and O
what O
broken O
bits O
food O
could O
come O
to O
Battery O
. O

Apart O
from O
this O
, O
he O
just O
writes O
exactly O
what O
the O
characters O
said O
. O

The O
voice O
is O
in O
first O
person O
and O
uses O
a O
subjective O
point O
of O
view O
. O

He O
only O
knows O
what O
he O
sees O
and O
thinks O
about O
it O
, O
but O
does O
not O
have O
any O
omniscient O
power O
. O

However O
, O
his O
power O
could O
be O
analyzing O
and O
describing O
the O
situations O
with O
a O
rich O
vocabulary O
in O
reflexive B-INCORRECT
way O
too O
. O

Also O
, O
he O
describes O
his O
parents O
in O
a O
hilarious O
way O
imaging B-INCORRECT
father O
as O
square O
stout O
dark O
man O
with O
curly O
black O
hair O
just B-INCORRECT
looking B-INCORRECT
at O
their O
tombstone O
. O

These O
twisted O
and O
creative O
thoughts O
are O
spread O
all B-INCORRECT
over B-INCORRECT
the O
text O
, O
accompanied O
by O
even O
more O
reflections O
like B-INCORRECT
at O
end O
of O
first O
chapters O
when O
he O
describes O
man B-INCORRECT
who O
stole B-INCORRECT
him O
as O
afraid O
dead O
bodies O
in O
graveyard O
just O
because O
saw O
hugging O
himself O
. O

Beside B-INCORRECT
this O
, O
the O
characters O
of O
novel O
seem O
to O
be O
unhappy O
living O
a O
sad O
and O
boring O
life O
that O
pushes O
them O
abuse O
our O
protagonist O
with O
exception O
Joe O
. O

The O
narrator O
does O
not O
make O
an O
effort O
to O
describe O
psychologically B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
other B-INCORRECT
characters B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
he B-INCORRECT
focuses O
on O
their O
appearance O
. O

Actually O
, O
we O
only O
know O
that O
Mrs. O
Joe O
tries O
to O
make O
her O
husband O
and O
hers B-INCORRECT
brother O
suffer O
she O
is B-INCORRECT
worries O
more B-INCORRECT
about O
what O
their O
neighbors O
think O
rather B-INCORRECT
than O
worrying O
the O
person B-INCORRECT
who O
live O
in O
his B-INCORRECT
own O
house O
. O

The O
narrator O
describes O
her O
as O
woman B-INCORRECT
that O
has O
earned O
a O
good O
reputation O
being B-INCORRECT
aggressive O
with B-INCORRECT
his B-INCORRECT
little O
brother O
. O

And O
we O
know O
that O
Joe O
is O
a B-INCORRECT
good O
man O
because O
the O
protagonist O
describes O
him O
as O
mild O
, O
- O
natured O
sweet O
tempered O
easy O
going O
and O
foolish O
but O
all O
about O
them O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
way O
characters O
talk O
is O
opposed O
to O
narrator O
writes O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the O
dialogues O
of O
each O
character O
are O
not O
longer O
than O
more O
two O
sentences O
with O
only B-INCORRECT
exception O
thief O
that B-INCORRECT
talks O
about O
his O
partner O
in O
twelve O
long O
complex O
structures O
. O

This O
kind O
of O
structure O
is O
widely O
used O
by O
the O
narrator O
, O
but O
characters O
usually O
talk O
with B-INCORRECT
short O
and O
simple O
sentences O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
here O
is O
an O
extract O
of O
the O
narrator O
at O
beginning O
second O
chapter O
: O

" O
My O
sister O
, O
Mrs. O
Joe O
Gargery O
was O
more O
than O
twenty O
years O
older O
I O
and O
had O
established O
a O
great O
reputation O
with O
herself O
the O
neighbours O
because O
she O
brought O
me O
up O
by O
hand O
. O

Having O
at O
that O
time O
to O
find O
out O
for O
myself O
what O
the O
expression O
meant O
, O
and O
knowing O
her O
have O
a O
hard O
heavy O
hand O
be O
much O
in O
habit O
of O
laying O
it O
upon O
husband O
as O
well O
me O
I O
supposed O
Joe O
Gargery O
were O
both O
brought O
up O
by O
. O
" O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
dialogues O
are O
simple O
and O
shorter O
: O

" O
Now O
lookee O
here O
, O
he O
said O
the O
question O
being O
whether O
you O
're O
to O
be O
let O
live O
. O
You O
know O

what O
a O
file O
is O
? O
" O

" O
Yes O
, O
sir O
. O

" O
And O
you O
know O
what O
wittles O
is O
? O

" O
Yes O
, O
sir O
. O

Moreover O
, O
the O
vocabulary O
used O
by O
narrator O
is O
opposed O
to O
what O
characters O
said O
. O

Pip O
uses O
a O
rich O
vocabulary O
, O
using O
lot O
of O
mental O
verbs O
and O
abstract O
concepts O
that O
are O
usually O
inspired O
by O
concrete O
things O
. O

The O
marsh O
pointed O
on B-INCORRECT
the O
first O
chapter O
is O
good B-INCORRECT
example O
. O

Regardless O
, O
the O
dialogues O
are O
written O
exactly O
as O
they O
were O
said O
. O

The O
thief O
said O
" O
Who O
d'ye O
with O
? O

This O
is O
written O
as O
it O
said O
, O
making O
more O
realistic O
. O

Notwithstanding O
, O
the O
way O
this O
novel O
is O
narrated O
protagonist O
. O

The O
events O
are O
narrated O
in O
a O
mysterious O
way O
, O
telling O
us O
what O
happened O
realistic O
story O
- O
line O
without O
flashback B-INCORRECT
. O

The O
story O
is O
narrated O
as O
it O
happens O
. O

The O
second O
chapter O
makes O
reference O
to O
the O
first O
and O
reveals O
something O
about O
thief O
. O

Also O
, O
the O
slow O
rhythm O
is O
adequate O
. O

The O
narrator O
reveals O
not O
so O
much O
about O
him B-INCORRECT
or O
the O
other O
characters O
, O
but O
he O
writes O
essential O
things O
we O
should O
know O
through B-INCORRECT
text O
. O

The O
thief O
disappears O
, O
but O
the O
first O
chapter O
ending B-INCORRECT
make B-INCORRECT
us O
feel O
curious O
about O
their O
next O
meeting O
. O

Therefore O
, O
I O
do O
not O
know O
how O
the O
story O
will O
end O
. O

Too O
much O
mystery O
and O
just O
a O
few O
facts O
can O
be O
read O
in O
these O
chapters O
. O

All O
I O
know O
is O
that O
this O
story O
will O
not O
have O
a O
happy O
ending O
. O

Probably O
, O
the O
thief O
will O
take O
Pip O
to B-INCORRECT
an O
unwanted O
adventure O
that O
make O
him O
growing B-INCORRECT
up O
faster O
. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
read O
a O
story O
where O
Pip O
ends O
as O
he O
starts O
, O
at B-INCORRECT
the O
graveyard O
. O

Like O
another O
brick O
in O
the O
wall O
, O
tombstone O
graveyard O
. O

I O
would O
like O
to O
read O
a O
story O
without O
tale O
, B-INCORRECT
just O
regular O
man O
who O
died O
while O
he O
was O
learning O
live O
. O

Obviously O
, O
this O
would O
be O
difficult O
as O
the O
narrator O
voice B-INCORRECT
clearly O
comes O
from O
a O
person O
who O
lives O
while O
he O
is O
writing O
. O

This O
is O
obvious O
when O
he O
makes O
reference O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
photography O
did O
not O
exist O
was O
a O
kid B-INCORRECT
. O

Consequently O
, O
reading O
these O
chapters O
is O
a O
pleasure O
but O
it O
difficult O
to O
tell O
what O
going O
happen O
or O
more O
the O
author O
trying O
transmit B-INCORRECT
. O

If O
the O
story O
has O
a O
happy O
ending O
, O
then O
central O
theme O
could O
be O
getting O
over O
adversities O
; O
if O
not O
it O
is O
sad O
. O

Anna O
knew O
that O
it O
was O
going O
to O
be O
a O
very O
special O
day O
for O
her O
. O

She O
has O
been O
waiting O
so O
long O
for O
this O
day O
to O
come O
. O

It O
was O
the O
day O
when O
she O
going O
to O
meet O
her O
biological O
mother O
. O

She O
knew B-INCORRECT
she O
was O
adopted O
since O
7 O
years O
old O
because O
her O
parents O
told O
about O
it O
. O

She O
did O
not O
feel O
bad O
about O
it O
because O
she O
loves B-INCORRECT
her O
parents O
very O
much O
and O
feels B-INCORRECT
loved O
by O
them O
. O

After O
her O
18th O
birthday O
, O
Anna O
felt O
a O
sudden O
necessity B-INCORRECT
of B-INCORRECT
knowing B-INCORRECT
what O
happened O
to O
bilogical B-INCORRECT
mother O
and O
why O
did B-INCORRECT
she O
gave O
away O
. O

After O
finding O
the O
adoption O
papers O
she B-INCORRECT
contacted O
adotpion B-INCORRECT
agency O
. O

She O
convinced O
the O
lady O
at O
agency O
to O
give O
her O
name O
of O
biological O
mother O
" O
little O
sister O
who O
had O
a O
disease O
and O
needed O
know O
if O
bilogical B-INCORRECT
would O
be O
match O
for O
kidney O
transplant O
. O

Even O
though O
it O
was O
illegal O
, O
the O
lady O
gave O
her O
name O
and O
contact O
phone O
number O
of O
Sara O
Fielding O
biological O
mother O
. O

A O
month O
passed O
by O
before O
she O
had O
the O
courage O
to O
dial O
that O
number O
. O

She O
hesitated O
several O
times O
because O
she O
was O
afraid O
of O
her O
mother O
's O
rejection O
. O

After O
a O
few O
seconds O
, O
woman O
picked O
up O
the O
phone O
. O

At O
the O
beginning O
Anna B-INCORRECT
did O
not O
say O
anything O
, O
she O
could O
utter O
any O
sound O
. O

But O
then O
she O
said O
" O
hello O
, O
my O
name O
is O
Anna O
and O
I O
think O
you O
are O
mother O
. O

After O
another O
few O
seconds O
of O
silence O
, O
Anna O
heard O
her O
mother O
crying O
and O
asking O
lots O
questions O
. O

They O
agreed O
to O
meet O
the O
next O
day O
in O
park O
. O

She O
was O
going O
to O
have O
so O
many O
answers O
questions O
. O

Anna O
will B-INCORRECT
be O
able O
to O
finally O
close O
an O
important O
chapter O
in O
her O
life O
and O
that O
is O
why O
she O
knew O
it O
was O
going O
a O
very O
special O
day O
. O

The O
most O
exciting O
day O
of O
my O
life O
. O

Last O
summer O
I O
went O
on O
holiday O
in B-INCORRECT
Sardegna O
, O
Italy O
with O
my O
family O
. O

On O
the O
first O
day O
I B-INCORRECT
was O
very O
angry O
because O
my B-INCORRECT
parents O
did O
n't O
take O
with B-INCORRECT
us B-INCORRECT
Ilaria B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
best B-INCORRECT
friend B-INCORRECT
. O

But O
I O
changed O
my O
mind O
when O
heard O
at B-INCORRECT
the O
radio O
that O
Felix O
Sandman O
, O
a O
Swedish O
singer O
was O
on O
Holiday O
in O
Sardegna O
near O
hotel O
! O

I O
love O
him O
and O
my O
dream O
was O
to O
meet O
, O
but O
knew O
it O
impossible O
parents O
did O
n't O
want O
drive O
me O
his O
hotel O
so O
quite O
sad O
. O

Unexpectedly O
, O
the B-INCORRECT
third O
day O
while O
I O
was O
swimming O
in O
sea O
saw O
some O
people O
distance O
and O
cameras O
but O
at O
moment B-INCORRECT
thought O
they O
were O
making O
a O
video O
. O

Then O
, B-INCORRECT
I O
realised O
the O
boy O
at O
centre O
was O
n't O
a B-INCORRECT
simple B-INCORRECT
He O
Felix O
! O

So O
I O
went O
toward O
the O
crowd O
and O
when O
he O
saw O
me O
smiled O
. O

I O
was O
really O
exciting B-INCORRECT
! O

Then O
I O
went O
to O
him O
and O
he O
took B-INCORRECT
a B-INCORRECT
photo B-INCORRECT
with O
me O
. O

He O
stayed O
there O
a O
few O
hours O
and O
I O
spent O
the O
best O
day O
of O
my O
life O
, B-INCORRECT
asking O
him O
some O
questions O
singing O
his O
songs O
. O

When O
he O
left O
I O
was O
sad O
but O
also O
really O
happy O
. O

This O
was O
certainly O
the O
most O
exciting O
day O
of O
my O
life O
. O

the O

places O

visit O
in O
Dublin O
for O
young O
people O
from O
a O
different O
country O

It O
is O
based O
on O
a O
survey O
of O
the O
young O
people O
from O
Whitehall O
College O
as O
well O
my O

opinion O
permanent O
resident O
in O
area O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
the O
majority O
of O
those O
surveyed O
are O
opinion O
best O
place O
to O
visit O
for O
young O

would O

discount O

The O
Dublin O
Wax O

was O
suggested O
by O
many O
students O
. O

Several O
people O
said O
that O
National B-INCORRECT
Botanic O
Garden O
is O
the O
best O
place O
for O
students O
to O
meet O

outdoors O
. O

On O
the O
whole O

are O
activities O
to O
take O
part O
in O
and O
many O
places O
visit O
depending O
on O
students O
preferences B-INCORRECT
finances B-INCORRECT
available O
them O
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
people O
everywhere O
like O
watching O
sports O
. O

Sports O
starts B-INCORRECT
being O
admired O
by O
youth B-INCORRECT
and O
can O
imprint O
a O
model O
of O
behavior O
on O
the O
young B-INCORRECT
's B-INCORRECT
minds B-INCORRECT
. O

In O
this O
essay O
both B-INCORRECT
sides O
of O
the O
position O
stated O
above O
will O
be O
analyzed O
before O
my O
own O
perspective O
is O
provided O
. O

From O
one O
point O
of O
view O
, O
top O
athletes O
are O
good O
models O
to O
emulate O
for O
several O
reasons O
. O

Firstly O
, O
watching O
the O
success O
of O
such O
athletes O
teenagers O
start O
to O
desire O
be O
like O
their O
idols O
and O
follow O
professional O
sports O
. O

This O
means O
they O
will O
want O
to O
play O
sports O
, O
which O
is O
essential O
for O
their O
health O
. O

Secondly O
, O
doing O
sports O
also O
teaches O
priceless O
life O
lessons O
such O
as O
discipline O
and O
dealing O
with O
success O
failure O
. O

The O
importance O
of O
working O
hard O
to O
achieve O
goalы B-INCORRECT
and O
practicing O
regularly O
become O
good O
at O
something O
are O
also O
demonstrated O
by O
professional O
sportsmen O
. O

This O
is O
a O
good O
example O
for O
youngsters O
to O
follow O
. O

From O
another O
perspective O
, O
sometimes O
professional B-INCORRECT
athletes O
are O
not O
good O
role O
models O
. O

Firstly O
, O
sport O
has O
become O
business O
. O

Many O
sports O
stars O
are O
only O
concerned O
about O
money O
and O
fame O
. O

This O
can O
lead O
adolescents O
to O
believe O
that O
money O
and O
fame O
are O
an O
important O
part O
of O
sports O
instead O
learning O
how O
play O
well O
having O
the O
fun O
game O
or O
competition O
. O

Secondly O
, O
there O
are O
those O
athletes O
who O
behave O
disgustingly O
. O

For O
example O
, O
some O
take O
drugs O
or O
cheat O
in O
order O
to O
win O
at O
any O
cost O
. O

It O
goes O
without O
saying O
, B-INCORRECT
that O
this O
kind O
of O
behavior O
sends O
a B-INCORRECT
wrong O
message O
to O
the O
young O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
there O
are O
a O
number O
of O
advantages O
and O
disadvantages O
in O
regard O
to O
professional O
sportsmen O
as O
good O
role O
models O
for O
young O
people O
. O

On O
balance O
, O
I O
am O
inclined O
to O
believe O
that O
professional O
athletes O
can O
be O
excellent O
role O
models O
for O
the O
youth B-INCORRECT
as O
long O
they O
represent O
positive O
aspects O
of O
playing O
sports O
. O

Dickens O
and O
the O
Bronte O
sisters O
use O
same O
style O
: O
realistic O
. O

They O
are O
influenced O
by O
the B-INCORRECT
surrounding B-INCORRECT

they O

Charlotte O
Bronte O
often O
use O
the B-INCORRECT
first O
person O
narrator O
or O
point O
of O
view O

story O
. O

Their O
realism O
is O
different O
: O
in B-INCORRECT
fact O
Dickens B-INCORRECT
' O
style O
that O
of O
sentimental O
which O
he O
mixes O
pathos O
and O
comedy O
, O
like O
characters O
tend O
to O
be O
caricatures O
the O

from O
the O

that O
some O

Dear O
Mr. O
Merrifield O
: O

My O
name O
is O
Dmitry O
Lavrov O
. O

I O
'm O
a O
postdoc O
in B-INCORRECT
Russian O
Cancer O
Research O
Center O
. O

Our O
lab O
works O
along O
with O
Alexis O
Hervieux O
on O
his O
study O
of O
arpin O
. O

Recently O
he B-INCORRECT
has B-INCORRECT
visited O
Moscow O
and O
while O
we O
've B-INCORRECT
been B-INCORRECT
having O
conversation B-INCORRECT
I B-INCORRECT
mentioned O
that O
was O
looking O
for O
the B-INCORRECT
opportunity O
to O
work O
on B-INCORRECT
postdoc O
position O
abroad O
. O

And O
since O
my O
great O
interest O
is O
to O
develop O
skills O
in O
microscopy O
and B-INCORRECT
digital O
image O
analysis O
while O
working O
the O
field O
of O
cell O
biology O
Alexis B-INCORRECT
told O
me O
try O
contact B-INCORRECT
you O
. O

Our O
conversation O
with O
Alexis O
and O
your O
own O
publications O
- B-INCORRECT
all O
supports B-INCORRECT
the O
suggestion O
that O
working O
in O
lab O
apparently O
will O
provide O
valuable O
opportunities O
to O
master O
methodological O
research O
skills O
. O

Not O
to O
mention O
the O
participation O
in O
pioneering B-INCORRECT
study O
. O

My O
own O
work O
is O
dedicated O
to O
the O
study O
of O
changes O
in O
cell O
- O
contacts O
and O
actin B-INCORRECT
cytoskeleton O
that O
take O
place O
during O
neoplastic O
transformation O
epithelial O
cells O
. O

Earlier O
I O
had O
a O
publication O
in O
PLoS O
One O
with O
description O
of O
dissimilarities O
organization B-INCORRECT
and O
regulation O
adherence O
junctions O
associated O
different O
types O
actin O
bundles O
normal O
transformed O
epithelial O
cells O
. O

Thereafter O
I B-INCORRECT
studied O
accumulation B-INCORRECT
of O
various O
actin O
- O
binding O
proteins O
and O
isoforms O
within O
adherence O
junction O
in O
normal O
transformed O
cells O
. O

On B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
coarse B-INCORRECT
of O
this O
investigation O
I B-INCORRECT
have O
obtained O
some O
promising O
results O
which O
'm O
going O
to O
report O
on O
FEBS O
- O
EMBO O
conference O
will O
take O
place O
in B-INCORRECT
Paris O
beginning O
september B-INCORRECT
. O

Also O
I B-INCORRECT
'm O
preparing O
materials O
for O
the O
next O
publication O
. O

Yours O
respectfully O
, O

Dmitry O
Lavrov O

P.S. O
There B-INCORRECT
are B-INCORRECT
my B-INCORRECT
CV O
and O
a O
copy O
of O
paper O
in B-INCORRECT
the O
attachment O
. O

I O
am O
writing O
about O
an O
important O
historical O
place O
which O
is O
my O
favourite O
one O
, B-INCORRECT
referring O
to O
Lugo O
city O
. O

I O
visited O
Lugo O
last O
summer O
and O
enjoyed O
myself O
very O
much O
. O

I O
walked O
through O
the O
old O
city O
, O
its O
beautiful O
squares O
and O
parks O
visited O
numerous O
churches O
including O
cathedral O
. O

There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
places O
in O
Lugo O
worth O
visiting O
. O

For O
example O
, O
you O
can O
walk O
around O
the O
Roman O
Wall O
which O
has B-INCORRECT
been B-INCORRECT
declared O
a O
protected O
UNESCO O
World O
Heritage O
Site O
in O
2000 O
because O
it O
is O
only O
world O
that O
complete O
. O

I O
think O
that O
Lugo O
is O
very O
beautiful O
. O

There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
shops O
where O
tourists O
and O
visitors O
can O
buy O
souvenirs O
there O
many O
restaurants O
you O
eat O
delicious O
typical O
dishes O
, O
for O
example O
octopus O
. O

In O
Lugo O
, O
many O
traditional O
parties O
and O
festivals O
take O
place O
. O

Among O
the O
most O
important O
I O
can O
mention O
San O
Froilán O
and O
Arde O
Lucus O
. O

From O
4th O
to O
12th O
October O
Lugo O
holds O
its O
San O
Froilán O
Fiestas O
. O

San O
Froilán O
is O
a O
festival O
of O
National O
Tourist O
Interest O
. O

This O
festival O
is O
dedicated O
to O
the O
city O
's O
patron O
saint O
, O
and O
it O
shows O
traditional O
Galician O
costumes O
folklore O
. O

Another O
important O
festival O
in O
Lugo O
is O
Arde O
Lucus O
. O

It O
is O
celebrated O
in O
June O
. O

During O
this O
festivity B-INCORRECT
, O
Lugo O
becomes O
the O
3rd O
century O
town O
once O
again O
so O
you O
can O
see O
Roman O
circus O
Celtic O
weddings O
artisan O
markets O
many O
musical O
events O
taking O
place O
and O
local O
people O
visitors O
get O
into O
period O
costumes O
such O
as O
gladiators O
Emperors O
. O

I O
recommend O
you O
visit O
Lugo O
in O
June O
because O
Arde O
Lucus O
is O
celebrated O
. O

You O
can O
enjoy O
traditional O
Roman O
customs O
and O
life O
in O
Arde O
Lucus O
. O

Lugo O
is O
and B-INCORRECT
incredible O
city O
it O
important O
in O
the O
history O
of O
my O
country O
because O
full O
historical O
places O
, B-INCORRECT
festivities B-INCORRECT
which O
show O
perform O
precise O
periods O
Spain O
such O
as O
Celtic O
period O
Roman O
. O

The O
bigger B-INCORRECT
the O
city O
, O
problem O
. O

The O
town O
is O
the O
2nd O
largest O
urban O
agglomeration O
in O
country O
, O
producing O
daily B-INCORRECT
large B-INCORRECT
amounts B-INCORRECT
of B-INCORRECT
waste B-INCORRECT
. O
" O

City O
X O
" O
has O
no O
specific O
waste O
disposal O
plan O
, O
but O
a O
federal O
law O
establishes O
due O
term O
until O
1st O
July O
. O

Despite O
it B-INCORRECT
, O
there O
are O
a O
few O
plans O
to O
increase O
the O
green O
areas O
and O
revitalize O
town O
. O

The O
city O
is O
thriving O
on O
implementing O
new O
measures O
to O
achieve O
the O
Council O
's O
goals O
. O

The B-INCORRECT
analysis O
will O
consist O
of O
evaluating O
the O
Council O
's O
eco O
- O
friendly O
proposals O
. O

In O
accord B-INCORRECT
with O
the O
aforementioned O
, O
amount O
of O
garbage O
produced O
during O
years O
2007 O
and O
2010 O
more O
than O
doubled O
86% O
it O
discarded O
inadequately O
. O

This O
is O
due O
to O
the O
low O
effect O
of O
" O
Recycling O
Worms O
program O
over B-INCORRECT
disposal O
problem O
. O

City O
X O
" O
incinerates O
hospital O
residue B-INCORRECT
, O
in O
accordance O
with O
legal O
requirements O
and O
send B-INCORRECT
7% O
of O
the O
garbage O
production O
to O
recycling O
factories O
. O

The O
recycling O
factories O
have O
a O
joint O
venture O
with O
the O
municipality O
to O
sort O
waste O
, O
and O
show O
result O
20% O
better O
than O
last O
year O
. O

The O
program O
represents O
2% O
of O
the B-INCORRECT
employment O
in O
city O
, O
but O
it O
needs O
to O
expand O
. O

The O
city O
has O
many O
projects O
such B-INCORRECT
as O
the B-INCORRECT
" O
Keep O
it O
clean O
, O
keep O
beauty B-INCORRECT
whose B-INCORRECT
goal B-INCORRECT
is O
to O
promote O
proper O
disposal O
in O
public O
areas O
. O

Another O
important O
one O
is O
the B-INCORRECT
" O
Let O
's O
make O
it O
green O
, O
responsible O
for O
increasing O
areas O
within O
city O
in B-INCORRECT
150% O
during B-INCORRECT
last O
two O
years O
consisting O
of O
a O
combination O
public O
and O
private O
investment O
reforestation O
rural O
communal O
. O

A O
later O
crucial O
activity O
are O
the O
" O
Green O
Communities O
, O
currently O
carrying O
38% O
of O
total O
amount O
consumed B-INCORRECT
vegetables B-INCORRECT
in O
metropolitan O
area O
. O

A O
municipal O
waste O
policy O
that O
integrates O
private O
and O
public O
sectors O
the O
community O
is O
required O
to O
solve O
current O
problem O
. O

The O
city O
needs O
a O
joint O
venture O
to O
support O
functional O
and O
sustainable O
commerce O
of O
recycled O
rubbish O
. O

The O
increase O
of B-INCORRECT
green O
areas O
represent B-INCORRECT
a O
significant O
improvement O
in B-INCORRECT
the O
quality O
life O
according O
to O
USED O
report O
2012 O
and O
also O
fits B-INCORRECT
16 O
20 O
requirements O
city O
future O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
" O
Recycling O
Worms O
problem O
is O
caused O
by O
this B-INCORRECT
lack O
training O
, O
which O
can O
be O
resolved O
offered O
in O
surrounding O
universities O
. O

It O
is O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
take O
year O
off O
between O
leaving O
school O
and O
starting O
university O
, O
because O
you O
can O
have O
lots O
of O
new O
experiences O
. O

For O
example O
, O
you O
can O
travel O
to O
new O
places O
. O

Another O
idea O
is O
you O
can O
work O
, O
find O
a O
job O
and O
earn O
money O
before O
start O
university O
. O

Moreover O
, O
sometimes O
people O
are O
tired O
when O
they O
finish O
school O
because O
of O
the O
exams O
so O
need O
to O
have O
some O
time O
relax O
. O

You O
can O
travel O
to O
different O
countries O
if O
you O
have O
time O
, B-INCORRECT
I O
would O
like O
go O
Asia O
Thailand O
or O
China O
. O

But O
you O
need O
to O
earn O
money O
if O
want O
travel O
, O
so O
can O
first O
work O
and O
then O
. O

You O
can O
find O
work O
as O
a O
waiter O
or O
in O
shop O
. O

However O
, O
some O
people O
think O
you O
should O
go O
to O
university O
immediately O
after O
finish O
school O
because O
if O
do O
n't O
forget O
what O
have O
learned O
in O
. O

But O
I O
think O
you O
can O
also O
learn O
if O
travel O
or O
work O
so O
that O
is O
a O
good O
idea O
, O
especially O
find O
job O
related O
with B-INCORRECT
what O
want O
to O
study O
. O

We O
live O
in O
a O
time O
when O
everything O
changes O
quickly O
. O

A B-INCORRECT
technological B-INCORRECT
development O
make B-INCORRECT
people O
believe O
that O
in O
the O
future O
everything O
will O
look O
like O
science O
- O
fiction O
movies O
. O

We O
'll O
be O
surrounded O
by O
machines O
and O
robots O
. O

We O
'll O
have O
a B-INCORRECT
possibility O
to O
choose O
on O
which O
planet O
we O
want O
live O
. O

And O
what O
about O
houses O
? O

Will O
people O
's O
homes O
be O
different O
or O
still O
the O
same O
? O

Imagining O
the O
future O
, O
I O
see O
everything O
different O
. O

The O
avant O
- O
garde O
and O
futuristic O
projects B-INCORRECT
of O
houses O
will O
be O
the O
most O
desirable O
. O

The O
houses O
will O
have O
, O
for O
example O
the O
shape O
of O
a O
sphere O
or O
igloo O
. O

Some O
of O
them O
might O
be O
turned O
upside O
down O
. O

Sometimes O
they B-INCORRECT
will O
be O
some O
kind O
of O
a B-INCORRECT
modern O
art B-INCORRECT
and O
it O
hard O
to O
describe O
shape O
. O

And O
what O
about O
interiors O
? O

In O
our O
service O
there O
will O
be O
more O
machines O
and O
robots O
with O
an B-INCORRECT
artificial O
intelligence O
. O

They O
will O
practically B-INCORRECT
do B-INCORRECT
everything O
: O
clean O
, O
cook O
remind O
us O
what O
we O
have O
to O
and O
also B-INCORRECT
speak O
with O
like O
an O
average B-INCORRECT
human O
. O

In O
practice O
there B-INCORRECT
will O
be O
no O
normal O
furniture O
, O
just O
machines O
waiting O
for O
a O
command O
. O

Everything O
will O
be O
artificial O
and O
uncozy B-INCORRECT
. O

That O
's O
how O
I O
see O
a B-INCORRECT
home O
of O
the O
future O
. O

Glad O
to O
hear O
that O
you O
've O
been O
invited O
attend O
the O
last O
round O
of O
interview O
next O
month O
! O

I O
really O
hope O
to O
work O
with O
you O
someday O
! O

To O
make O
sure O
you O
get O
the O
position O
successfully O
, O
here O
are B-INCORRECT
some O
useful O
advice O
and O
information O
might O
want O
to O
know O
. O

At O
the O
interview O
, O
leaving O
interviewers O
a B-INCORRECT
good O
impression O
is O
of O
great O
importance O
. O
Here're B-INCORRECT
some O
tips O
on O
how O
to O
do O
it O

First O
, O
dressing O
as O
properly B-INCORRECT
possible O
. O

Businesslike O
suits O
and O
ties O
fit O
in O
well O
with O
the O
formal O
occasion O
. O

Suitable O
dressing B-INCORRECT
comes O
across O
as O
effective O
and O
reliable O
. O

Second O
, O
being O
punctual O
. O

Interviewers O
have O
to O
cope O
with O
tight B-INCORRECT
schedule O
everyday B-INCORRECT
so O
they O
are O
n't O
willing O
spare O
one O
more O
minute O
wait O
for O
a O
candidate O
who O
's O
late O
somehow O
. O

Third O
, O
being O
prepared O
. O

As O
the O
old O
saying O
goes O
, O
well O
prepared O
is O
half O
done O
. O

You O
're O
expected O
to O
know O
something O
about O
our O
company O
, O
ask O
proper O
questions O
and O
communicate O
effectively O
with O
interviewers O
. O

If O
you O
can O
learn O
as O
much O
knowledge O
about O
our O
company O
up O
front O
, O
really O
stand O
a O
chance O
in O
the O
interview O
. O

Since O
you O
've O
applied O
for O
the O
sales O
assistant O
in B-INCORRECT
department O
, O
manager O
will O
be O
interviewing O
. O

He O
started O
out O
his O
career O
as O
an O
accountant O
, O
but O
he O
was O
fed O
up O
with O
dealing O
numbers O
all O
day O
long O
. O

Plus O
, O
he O
's O
willing O
to O
communicate O
with O
others O
and O
take O
on O
new O
challenges O
so O
transferred O
the O
sales O
department O
two O
years O
ago O
. O

He O
got O
promoted O
very O
quickly O
because O
he O
always O
brought O
forth O
new O
ideas O
and O
facilitated O
the O
reform O
development O
in O
department O
. O

In O
his O
eyes O
, O
what O
counts O
most O
is O
the O
track O
record O
and O
capabilities O
shown O
in O
previous O
working O
experiences O
so O
he O
might O
ask O
you O
some O
questions O
like O
achieved O
how O
felt O
about O
your O
last O
job O
. O

I O
hope O
what O
mention O
above O
will O
be O
of O
some O
help O
to O
you O
. O

Looking O
forward O
to O
hearing O
from O
you O
soon O
. O

Lots O
of O
Love O
, O

Iris O

Dear O
Sir O
or O
Madam O

I O
write O
in O
connection O
with O
your O
advertisement O
regarding O
jobs O
at O
summer O
camps O
all O
over O
the O
USA O
. O

Since O
my O
mother O
tongue O
is O
English O
, O
albeit O
of O
the O
British O
variety O
and O
I O
am O
generally O
deemed O
cheerful O
energetic O
hard O
working O
believe O
a O
suitable O
candidate O
for O
aforementioned O
position O
. O

Additionally O
, O
as O
a O
teenager O
I O
supervised O
Wolf O
Cub O
pack O
of O
eight B-INCORRECT
to O
twelve O
- O
year O
olds O
and O
often O
organised O
sports O
evening O
activities O
for O
them O
such O
treasure O
hunts O
paper O
chases O
. O

Moreover O
, O
when O
an O
undergraduate O
I O
spent O
my O
summers O
working O
in O
the O
college O
canteen O
as O
a O
kitchen O
help O
and O
progressed O
to O
position O
of O
cook O
. O

Because O
of O
all O
the O
above O
points O
, O
I O
think O
am O
a O
suitable O
person O
for O
job O
. O

Yours O
faithfully O

I O
find O
it O
quite O
difficult O
to O
an O
area O
of O
improvement O
given O
Andres O
's O
outstanding O
overall O
performance O
. O

Yet O
, O
oftentimes B-INCORRECT
being O
overly O
respectful O
may O
play O
against O
him O
and O
although B-INCORRECT
he O
has O
gained O
the O
respect O
of O
all O
people O
worked O
with O
some O
them O
suggested O
should O
build O
up O
his O
self O
- O
confidence O
rather O
than O
end O
attempting O
to O
cover O
everyone O
's O
back O
taking O
ownership O
for B-INCORRECT
other O
mistakes O
. O

If O
I B-INCORRECT
had O
my O
own O
language O
school O
would O
first O
bear O
in O
mind O
a O
main O
goal O
: O
raising O
public O
awareness O
of O
and O
the O
services O
it O
will O
provide O
. O

Then O
I O
would O
start O
gathering O
some O
information O
about O
the O
market O
, O
that O
is O
to O
say O
social O
trends O
population O
statistics O
such B-INCORRECT
as O
age O
gender O
and O
family O
type O
potential O
customers O
competitors O
well O
. O

By O
doing O
so O
, O
I O
would O
be O
able O
not O
only O
to O
identify O
the O
strengths O
and O
weaknesses O
of O
my O
product O
improve O
performance O
but B-INCORRECT
also O
customers O
' O
needs O
. O

After O
that O
, O
I O
would O
make O
a O
list O
of O
target O
markets O
and O
device B-INCORRECT
some O
strategies O
to O
attract O
them O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
if O
my O
goal O
was O
to O
increase O
young O
people O
's O
awareness O
some O
strategies O
could O
be O
online O
social O
media O
presence O
by O
posting O
regular O
updates O
about O
language O
school O
on O
Twitter O
and O
Facebook O
or O
offer O
discounts O
for O
sibblings B-INCORRECT
. O

Instead O
, O
if O
my O
goal O
was O
to O
increase O
adult B-INCORRECT
's B-INCORRECT
awarenes B-INCORRECT
advertising O
in O
local O
newspapers O
or O
offering O
intensive O
courses O
could O
prove O
successful O
. O

However O
, B-INCORRECT
if O
the O
target O
markets O
were O
both O
young O
people O
and O
adults O
offering O
discounts O
for O
family O
groups O
could O
be O
a O
better O
choice O
. O

The O
last O
step O
would O
be O
to O
recruit O
a O
staff O
of O
prfesional B-INCORRECT
, O
experienced O
and O
qualified O
teachers O
set O
an O
attractive O
reasonable O
price O
for O
the O
services O
I O
provide O
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
I O
would O
test O
ideas O
and O
approaches O
on O
customers O
staff O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
my O
marketing O
plan O
succeeded O
. O

And O
you O
? O

Have O
you O
ever O
thought O
about O
how O
can B-INCORRECT
promote O
your O
language O
courses O
for B-INCORRECT
example O
? O

I O
challenge O
you O
to O
think O
about O
it O
and O
try O
. O

According O
to O
recent O
research O
, O
there O
are O
no O
doubts O
that O
natural O
gas O
drilling O
rigs O
pipelines O
and O
underground O
storage O
contribute O
increasing B-INCORRECT
wealth O
of O
the B-INCORRECT
local O
communities O
. O

People O
who O
live O
in O
the O
areas O
of O
natural O
gas O
infrastructure O
earn O
from O
a O
few O
to O
several O
percent O
more O
than O
those O
other O
regions O
where O
such O
an O
does O
n't O
exist O
. O

Another O
advantage O
is O
that O
developing B-INCORRECT
natural O
gas O
industry O
equals O
new O
jobs O
what B-INCORRECT
profitable O
for O
people O
living O
in O
whereabouts B-INCORRECT
. O

Exploration O
and O
extraction O
of O
the B-INCORRECT
shale O
gas B-INCORRECT
will O
create O
lots O
new O
jobs O
in O
very O
different O
branches O
connected O
with O
industry O
for B-INCORRECT
instance B-INCORRECT
exploration O
, O
mining O
production O
distribution O
. O

We O
can O
not O
ignore O
the O
fact O
that O
companies O
which O
cooperate O
with O
this O
infrastructure O
will O
also O
create O
vacancy B-INCORRECT
jobs B-INCORRECT
. O

Even O
if O
companies O
will B-INCORRECT
hire O
engineers O
and O
specialists O
mostly O
from O
abroad O
, O
there O
be O
upgrowth B-INCORRECT
in O
a B-INCORRECT
number O
of O
job O
positions O
gastronomy B-INCORRECT
hospitality O
zones B-INCORRECT
as B-INCORRECT
they O
need O
to O
eat O
sleep O
somewhere O
. O

According O
to O
the O
dynamics O
of O
development O
natural O
gas O
infrastructure O
, O
there O
will O
be O
constant O
in O
gastronomy B-INCORRECT
and O
hospitality O
sectors O
as O
well O
. O

The O
Kosciuszko O
Institute O
conducted O
a B-INCORRECT
research O
which O
shows O
that O
Poland O
can O
benefit O
from O
extracting O
and O
developing O
the O
infrastructure O
of O
shale O
gas O

Greece O
is O
an O
amazing O
country O
that O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
visit O
annually O
. O

When O
planning O
their O
vacation O
a B-INCORRECT
lot O
of O
tourists O
are O
faced O
with O
the O
dilemma O
which O
places O
to O
visit O
. O

Choosing O
where O
to O
go O
in O
Greece O
can O
be O
hard O
as B-INCORRECT
there O
are O
so O
many O
choices O
. O

There O
are O
some O
travel O
destinations O
that O
definitely O
stand O
out O
, O
such O
as O
Santorini O
. O

Sandy O
beaches O
, O
crystal O
clear B-INCORRECT
waters O
and O
the O
friendly O
locals O
are O
not O
only O
things O
that O
set O
it O
apart O
from O
other O
islands O
. O

Santorini O
also O
has O
a O
volcano O
which O
is O
spectacular O
sight O
, O
even O
though O
exploring O
it O
can O
be O
dangerous O
! O

Another O
place O
worth O
visiting O
in O
Greece O
is O
Athens O
. O

Believe O
it O
or O
not O
, O
Athens O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
beautiful O
cities O
in O
world O
. O

The O
Parthenon O
, O
the O
Acropolis O
Museum O
and O
district O
of O
Monastiraki O
are O
just O
a O
few O
things O
that O
people O
love O
about O
Athens O
. O

Last O
but O
not O
least O
, O
Crete O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
spectacular O
islands O
in O
Greece O
. O

Other B-INCORRECT
than B-INCORRECT
having O
beautiful O
sandy O
beaches O
and O
being O
the O
largest O
island O
in O
Greece O
, O
people O
can O
visit O
water O
sports O
parks O
there O
which O
are O
extremely O
fun B-INCORRECT
! O

Summing O
up O
, O
Greece O
is O
a O
beautiful O
country O
worth O
visiting O
although O
choosing O
where O
to O
go O
can O
be O
hard O
. O

The O
question O
is O
whether O
it O
's O
better O
to O
prepare O
for O
a O
long O
time O
before O
the O
exam O
or O
few B-INCORRECT
days O
are O
going O
be O
enough O
. O

In B-INCORRECT
my O
personal O
experience O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
it O
's O
much O
better O
to O
prepare O
for O
a O
long O
time O
before O
any O
exam O
you O
may O
face O
in O
your O
life O
. O

It O
's O
quite O
important O
to O
be O
organized O
get O
the O
highest O
score O
you O
can O
in O
your O
exam O
. O

For O
example O
, O
one O
year O
ago O
I O
had O
my O
final O
surgery O
exam O
. O

I O
had O
set O
up O
a O
plan O
to O
study O
all O
the O
books O
we O
go O
through O
for O
exam O
plus O
reviewing O
them O
twice O
. O

The O
plan O
required O
my O
commitment O
for O
around O
a B-INCORRECT
12 O
hours O
daily B-INCORRECT
study O
almost O
3 O
months O
. O

For B-INCORRECT
the O
hard O
work O
and O
perfect O
discipline O
, O
I O
was O
able O
to O
get O
a O
very O
high O
score O
in O
my O
Surgery O
finals O
. O

If O
I O
had O
n't O
such O
an O
organized O
plan O
, O
would O
never O
have O
got O
a O
perfect O
score O
. O

Another O
thing O
to O
add O
is O
not O
being O
stressed O
before B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
exam B-INCORRECT
night B-INCORRECT
. O

It O
's O
quite O
normal O
to O
have O
this O
basic O
feeling O
of O
being O
stressed O
and O
nervous O
when O
exams O
are O
approaching O
. O

What O
is O
not O
normal O
at O
all O
having O
anxiety O
due O
to O
the O
plethora O
of O
studies O
you O
haven't O
finished O
and O
are B-INCORRECT
included O
in O
your O
exam O
. O

For O
example O
, O
I O
once O
had O
a O
chemistry O
exam O
in O
high O
school O
and O
was O
ignorant O
enough O
to O
neglect O
my O
studies O
thinking B-INCORRECT
that O
still O
time O
ace O
. O

Two O
days O
before O
my O
exam O
, O
I O
realized O
that O
ran B-INCORRECT
out O
of O
time O
. O

I O
had O
insomnia O
the O
night O
of B-INCORRECT
my O
exam O
, B-INCORRECT
it B-INCORRECT
was O
n't O
enough O
that O
well O
prepared O
but B-INCORRECT
also O
nerves O
got O
torn B-INCORRECT
out B-INCORRECT
and O
affected O
scores O
tremendously O
. O

Ever O
since O
I B-INCORRECT
do O
everything O
in O
its O
due O
time O
order O
not O
to O
be O
overly O
stressed O
and O
get O
low O
scores O
. O

Moreover O
, O
if O
I O
aim O
at O
getting O
high O
scores O
assert O
that O
memorizing O
the O
details O
is O
important O
. O

If O
you O
do O
n't O
start O
studying O
before O
exam B-INCORRECT
with B-INCORRECT
an O
appropriate O
time O
, O
will O
only O
have O
enough O
to O
know O
the B-INCORRECT
broad O
lines B-INCORRECT
of O
subject O
but O
this O
never O
help O
soak O
details O
and O
understand O
concepts O
lying O
behind O
every O
single O
word O
. O

That O
will O
help O
you O
a O
lot O
even O
if O
do O
n't O
get O
the O
chance O
to O
revise O
everything O
before O
your O
exam O
. O

I O
can O
recall O
that B-INCORRECT
time O
when O
was O
quite O
ill O
before O
my O
Anatomy O
exam O
; O
could O
only O
go O
through O
the O
main O
titles O
of O
each O
branch O
without O
going O
details O
. O

In O
the O
exam O
, O
I O
had O
that B-INCORRECT
question O
where O
it O
required O
describing O
a O
concept O
; O
amazingly O
was O
able O
to O
do O
perfectly O
. O

Since B-INCORRECT
I O
had O
practiced O
a O
lot O
and O
memorized O
that O
concept O
before O
many O
times O
, O
was O
able O
to O
remember O
it O
. O

It O
was O
just O
flooding O
without B-INCORRECT
so O
much O
effort O
. O

So O
, O
for O
sure O
having B-INCORRECT
enough O
time O
to O
memorize O
and O
practice O
what O
you O
learn O
is O
going O
help O
a O
lot O
in O
your O
exam O
. O

In O
sum O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
setting O
a O
schedule O
to O
have O
long O
time B-INCORRECT
preparation O
plan O
is O
much O
better O
than O
having O
only O
few B-INCORRECT
days O
get O
prepared O
. O
If O
you O
want O
high O
scores O
and O
perform O
greatly B-INCORRECT
should O
start O
studying O
from O
day O
one O
if O
possible O

Do O
n't O
you O
think O
are O
worth O
getting O
the O
highest O
score O
one O
could O
aim O
at B-INCORRECT
? O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
nuclear O
energy O
has O
the O
best O
chance O
to O
replace O
fossil O
fuels O
. O

Firstly O
, O
nuclear O
energy O
is O
n't O
bad O
for O
the O
environment O
. O

The O
Carbon B-INCORRECT
dioxide O
emissions O
is B-INCORRECT
very O
small O
. O

The O
biggest O
threat O
is O
the B-INCORRECT
explosion O
. O

However O
, O
the O
technology O
is O
evolving O
and O
nuclear O
power O
plants O
are O
getting O
safer O
. O

Secondly O
, O
nuclear O
power O
plants O
are O
already O
very O
popular O
and O
this O
type O
of O
energy O
is O
the O
closest O
to O
replace B-INCORRECT
fossil O
fuels O
. O

Energy O
which O
we O
get O
from O
sun O
and O
wind O
is O
still O
are B-INCORRECT
only O
a O
few O
percent O
of O
world O
energy O
production O
. O

Thirdly O
, O
only O
the O
construction O
of O
a O
nuclear O
power O
plant O
is O
expensive O
. O

When B-INCORRECT
we O
have O
a O
plant O
, O
making O
energy O
from O
that O
is O
very O
cheap O
. O

The O
most O
expensive O
thing O
in O
nuclear B-INCORRECT
plant B-INCORRECT
is O
to B-INCORRECT
hire B-INCORRECT
qualified O
personnel O
. O

Besides B-INCORRECT
, O
we O
need O
something O
that O
can O
work O
all O
the O
time O
. O

It O
ca O
n't O
stop O
making O
energy O
when O
the O
weather O
is O
bad O
, O
because O
people O
need O
a O
lot O
of O
electricity O
. O

If O
we O
run O
out O
of O
power O
entire B-INCORRECT
cities O
could O
plunge B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
chaos O
, O
and O
this B-INCORRECT
is O
unacceptable O
. O

Lima O

the O
only O

it O

Hi O
Jane O
, O

Last O
time O
you O
asked O
me O
for O
some O
information O
about O
opening O
a O
saving B-INCORRECT
account O
in O
the O
UK O
. O
I O
've O
done O
research O
to O
find O
out B-INCORRECT
best O
savings O

Below O
you O
can O
find O
a O
few O
suggestions O
of O
mine O
. O

The O
Phone O
Bank O
might O
give B-INCORRECT
quite O
a O
good O
offer O
for O
you O
. O

Firstly O
, O
the O
rate O
of O
interest O
is O
by O
3.1% O
which O
quite O
good O
. O

Additionally O
, O
if O
you O
open O
a O
saving B-INCORRECT
account O
in B-INCORRECT
that O
bank O
will O
get O
diary O
as O
gift O
. O

And O
you O
do O
not O
need O
to O
pay O
any O
annual O
charges O
for O
having O
a O
credit O
card O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
bank O
does O
n't O
have O
branches O
in O
Britain O
. O

And O
all O
banking O
operations O
must O
be O
done O
by O
phone O
. O

The O
second O
bank B-INCORRECT
, O
Royal O
Savings O
Bank O
has O
many O
branches O
in O
the O
UK O
( O
over O
650 O
) O
so O
you O
can O
make B-INCORRECT
all O
operations B-INCORRECT
on O
spot B-INCORRECT
. O

But O
there O
is O
a O
service O
charge O
for O
owning O
credit O
card O
( O
£ O
12 O
per O
year O
) O
. O

You O
do O
also O
get O
a O
gift O
as O
new O
account O
holder O
, B-INCORRECT
full O
set O
of O
saucepans O
( O
you O
really O
need O
it B-INCORRECT
? O
) O
. O

All O
in B-INCORRECT
all O
, O
I O
would O
recommend O
you O
to O
open O
your O
first O
serving B-INCORRECT
account O
the O
Phone O
Bank O
since O
rate O
of O
interest O
is O
higher O
and O
do O
n't O
need O
pay O
any O
annual O
charges O
. O

And O
doing O
operations B-INCORRECT
by O
phone O
are B-INCORRECT
actually O
very O
easy O
and O
they O
always O
give O
you O
a O
great O
opportunity O
to O
improve O
your O
English O
. O

The O
final O
decision O
is O
yours O
. O

Take O
care O
and O
see O
you O
very O
soon O
, O

Yours O

It O
must O
have O
been O
my O
friend O
, O
Marius O
Boni O
who O
recommended O
me O
for O
this O
service O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
believe O
my O
ears O
when O
the O
phone O
rang O
and O
answered O
they O
said O
wanted O
me O
to O
get O
at B-INCORRECT
concert O
as O
soon O
possible O
see O
how O
good O
was O
in B-INCORRECT
sound O
recording O
. O

What O
can O
I O
say O
? O

It O
's O
been O
my O
dream O
since O
childhood O
and O
now B-INCORRECT
I O
was O
overwhelmed O
when O
realised O
they O
thought O
at B-INCORRECT
me O
to O
do O
this O
for O
such O
a O
great O
, O
important O
person O
in O
the O
world O
music O
industry O
. O

I O
am O
glad O
that O
they O
were O
satisfied O
with O
my O
service B-INCORRECT
. O

I O
can O
hardly O
wait O
for B-INCORRECT
you B-INCORRECT
to O
see O
and O
share O
with B-INCORRECT
my O
happiness O
tell O
all O
the O
details O
of O
this O
unique O
experience O
! O

Yours O
, O

Ionut O

I O
have O
been O
skiing O
for O
most O
of O
life B-INCORRECT
and O
am O
very O
enthusiastic O
about O
it O
. O

I O
started O
when O
was O
six O
with O
equipment O
that O
very O
basic O
compared O
to O
what O
skiers O
use O
these O
days O
. O

Every O
day O
as B-INCORRECT
soon O
I B-INCORRECT
woke O
up O
looked O
forward O
to O
my O
morning O
on O
the O
slopes O
. O

My O
parents O
would O
take O
me O
to O
a O
gentle O
slope O
with O
my O
brother O
and O
leave O
us O
there O
for O
couple O
of O
hours O
try O
skiing O
on O
our O
own O
. O

The O
temperature O
was O
often O
several O
degrees O
below O
zero O
, O
and O
you O
would O
freeze O
if O
did O
n't O
keep O
moving O
up O
down O
the O
slope O
. O

My O
brother O
showed O
a O
natural O
talent O
for O
the O
sport O
, O
but O
I O
felt O
quite O
uncomfortable O
and O
scared O
. O

Little O
by O
little O
I B-INCORRECT
improved O
my O
skiing O
skills O
and O
the O
time O
was O
a O
teenager O
really O
started O
enjoying O
myself O
. O

Nowadays O
I B-INCORRECT
have O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
skiing O
because O
it O
gives O
me O
the O
opportunity O
to O
be O
in O
wonderful O
natural O
environment O
. O

Skiing O
is O
a O
great O
sport O
, O
but O
I O
would O
recommend O
starting O
as O
child O
taking O
few O
lessons O
with O
an O
experienced O
instructor O
and O
using O
the O
right O
equipment O
. O

After O
six O
years O
of O
rigorous O
high O
school O
subjects B-INCORRECT
and O
past O
experiences O
, O
I O
have O
no O
doubt O
that O
the O
preferences B-INCORRECT
've O
selected O
above O
are O
not O
accidental O
. O

I O
am O
extremely O
interested O
in O
gaining O
experience O
the O
business O
field O
. O

The O
subjects O
I O
've O
pursued O
at O
my B-INCORRECT
high O
school O
level O
such B-INCORRECT
as O
financial O
accounting O
, O
commerce O
and O
economics O
has B-INCORRECT
given O
me O
the O
opportunity O
to O
utilize O
put O
into O
perspective O
knowledge O
of O
understanding O
business O
concepts O
a O
solid O
academic O
foundation O
. O

I O
've O
also O
participated O
in O
various O
group O
works B-INCORRECT
and O
class O
projects O
while O
high O
school O
. O

I O
am O
planning O
to O
gain O
admission O
into B-INCORRECT
the O
university O
of O
my O
choice O
in O
order O
obtain O
a O
bachelor O
's O
degree O
. O

I O
would O
love O
to O
associate B-INCORRECT
with O
extremely O
talented O
students O
, O
lecturers O
and O
even O
professors O
in O
order O
receive O
a O
well O
rounded O
introduction O
the O
numerous O
aspects O
of O
any O
preferences B-INCORRECT
've O
selected O
above O
. O

Academically O
, O
I O
've O
always O
been O
a O
very O
determined O
and O
studious O
individual O
would O
be O
more O
than O
willing O
to O
devote O
myself O
the O
hardwork B-INCORRECT
necessary O
in O
order O
achieve O
bachelor O
's O
degree O
. O

I O
also O
have O
an O
indubitable O
passion O
for O
extra O
- O
curricular O
activities O
. O

I O
was O
the O
president O
of O
Business O
Students O
Association O
( O
BSA O
) O
, O
Head O
Boy O
senior O
prefect O
boy B-INCORRECT
and O
Captain O
soccer B-INCORRECT
school B-INCORRECT
team O
. O

I O
am O
a B-INCORRECT
very O
good O
soccer O
player O
who O
plays O
midfield O
role B-INCORRECT
. O

Undertaking O
a O
scholarship O
and O
admission O
into B-INCORRECT
one O
of O
the O
universities O
I O
have B-INCORRECT
selected O
above O
will O
provide O
me O
with O
opprtunity B-INCORRECT
to O
apply O
knowledge O
gained O
at O
high O
school O
business O
setting O
, O
as O
well O
develop O
communication O
organisation O
numeracy O
skills O
acquired O
. O

After O
I O
heard O
about O
the O
Czech O
Government O
Scholarship O
, O
decided O
to O
make B-INCORRECT
some O
research O
on O
Republic O
before O
taking O
any O
step O
in B-INCORRECT
applying O
. O

I O
found O
out O
that O
Czech O
Republic O
is O
a O
country O
with O
rich O
possibilities O
for O
students O
planning O
to O
study O
abroad O
and O
currently O
undergoing O
rapid O
social O
changes O
transformation O
, O
making O
it O
fascinating O
place O
of O
any O
discipline O
in O
. O

Czech O
universities O
provides B-INCORRECT
high O
standards O
of O
education O
, O
internationally O
recognized O
degrees O
modern O
campuses O
with O
outstanding O
facilities O
safe B-INCORRECT
and O
affordable O
warm B-INCORRECT
friendly O
environment O
cultural O
diversity O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
will O
have O
the O
opportunity O
to O
experience O
both O
modernity O
and O
tradition O
in O
one O
if O
safest O
most O
stable O
countries O
Europe O
. O

Above O
all O
, O
the O
high O
quality O
if B-INCORRECT
education O
will O
make O
me O
ready O
for O
future O
. O

Another O
major O
reason O
why O
I O
am O
being B-INCORRECT
motivated O
to O
study O
in O
Czech O
Republic O
is O
lack O
of O
finance O
. O

Also O
, O
education O
in O
Nigeria O
is O
now O
a O
joke O
as O
teachers O
and O
lecturers O
go O
on O
strike O
frequently O
learning B-INCORRECT
some O
parts O
of O
are B-INCORRECT
not O
safe O
! O

Right O
now O
, O
I O
am O
greatly O
looking O
forward O
to O
the B-INCORRECT
challenges O
of O
a B-INCORRECT
university B-INCORRECT
life O
academically O
socially O
and O
mentally O
believe O
that O
my O
ambition O
learn O
new O
business O
concepts O
coupled O
with O
passion O
for O
extra O
- O
curricular O
activities O
community O
service O
would O
make O
me O
competent O
addition O
any O
proposed B-INCORRECT
Czech O
Republic O
Scholarship O
team O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
can O
make O
a O
positive O
contribution O
to O
my O
proposed B-INCORRECT
university O
, O
as O
will O
be O
actively O
involved O
in O
student O
events O
and O
activities O
help O
promote O
healthy O
learning O
environment O
for O
all O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
can O
assure O
you O
that O
will O
be O
a O
capable O
and O
dedicated O
student O
who O
has O
the O
committment B-INCORRECT
dedication O
to O
work O
hard O
in O
order O
graduate O
whilst O
at O
same O
time O
contributing O
greatly O
my O
proposed B-INCORRECT
university O
more O
ways O
than O
one O
. O

A O
dog O
is O
man O
's O
best O
friend O

It O
is O
a O
well O
- O
known O
fact O
that O
people O
need O
to O
have O
communication O
with O
other O
. O

However O
, O
they O
are O
not O
always O
satisfied O
or O
taken O
into O
the O
society O
. O

They O
seek O
solace O
in O
someone O
who O
they O
would B-INCORRECT
feel O
more O
comfortable O
with O
. O

The O
best O
example O
is O
an O
animal O
with O
great O
qualities O
, O
a O
dog O
. O

Dog B-INCORRECT
's O
personality O
is O
one O
of O
their B-INCORRECT
best O
qualities O
. O

Always O
friendly O
, O
bubbly O
and O
in O
a O
good O
mood O
they O
are O
great O
to O
spend O
time O
with O
. O

They O
feel B-INCORRECT
when O
their O
master O
is O
sad O
and O
react O
by O
cuddling O
up O
to O
them O
. O

It O
makes O
people O
forget O
all O
about O
their O
problems O
and O
concentrate O
on O
the O
things O
that O
really O
matter O
. O

Dog B-INCORRECT
's O
optimism O
is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
way O
to O
bring O
back O
a O
smile O
on B-INCORRECT
people O
face B-INCORRECT
. O

And O
that O
is O
what O
they O
are O
there O
for O
, O
to O
make O
people O
happy O
. O

These O
hairy O
four O
- O
legged O
animals O
are O
also O
very O
protective O
. O

One O
of O
their O
jobs O
is O
to O
watch O
out B-INCORRECT
human O
family O
. O

So O
if O
they O
sense O
that O
their O
owner O
might O
be O
in O
danger O
, O
immediately O
react O
by O
barking O
at O
a O
person O
or O
thing B-INCORRECT
have O
caused O
it O
. O

The O
stronger O
the O
bond O
between O
dog O
and O
their O
owner O
, O
's O
reaction O
will O
be O
. O

It O
is O
believed O
that O
dogs O
require O
a O
lot O
of O
attention O
, O
which O
not O
true O
. O

Dogs O
are O
really O
not O
that O
hard O
to O
take O
care O
of O
, B-INCORRECT
bathing B-INCORRECT
and O
grooming O
do O
n't O
need O
be O
done O
every O
day O
they O
just O
fed O
walked O
regularly O
. O

These O
pets O
need O
a O
few O
walks O
day O
, O
which O
could O
also O
be O
good O
for O
their O
owners O
who O
are B-INCORRECT
spending B-INCORRECT
all O
at O
work O
or O
in O
school O
and O
some O
physical O
activity O
. O

So O
having B-INCORRECT
a O
dog O
could O
also O
remind O
them O
to O
live O
healthier O
life O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
dogs O
make O
really O
great O
pets O
. O

Not O
only O
do O
they O
protect O
you O
from O
anything O
that O
could O
any O
harm O
, O
but O
their O
amazing O
personality O
and O
the O
love O
show O
to O
makes O
feel O
so O
warm O
wonderful O
on O
inside O
. O

So O
if B-INCORRECT
someone O
really O
loves O
their O
pet O
, O
they O
would B-INCORRECT
find O
time O
to O
pay O
lot B-INCORRECT
of O
attention O
them O
because O
truly O
are O
man O
's O
best O
friend O
. O

Hi O
John O
! O

It O
's O
great O
to O
hear O
from O
you O
again O
! O
I O
will O
give O
some O
details O
about O
my O
experience O
at O
" O
Zoe O
Kak O
adventure O
, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
well O
- O
known O
centres O
in O
our O
country O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
we O
started O
with O
a O
tiring O
assault O
course O
which O
consisted O
climbing O
up O
pretty O
sharp O
walls O
and O
crawling O
through O
different O
obstacles O
. O

Although O
it O
made O
me O
feel O
exhausted O
, O
I O
found O
extremely O
entertaining O
. O

Luckily O
, O
I O
was O
fit O
enough O
to O
finish O
the O
exercise O
without O
having O
any O
problem B-INCORRECT
however O
you O
may O
need O
train B-INCORRECT
a O
little O
bit O
more O
before O
embarking O
on O
this O
activity O
. O

Rock O
climbing O
was O
another O
of O
the O
challenges O
I O
had O
to O
face O
. O

Despite O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
harder O
than O
I O
had O
expected O
, O
managed O
reach O
summit O
. O

You O
ca O
n't O
imagine O
how O
rewarding O
is B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
feeling B-INCORRECT
of B-INCORRECT
being B-INCORRECT
on B-INCORRECT
top B-INCORRECT
mountain B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
after O
such O
a O
big O
effort!. O

Furthermore O
, O
you O
will O
be O
able O
to O
practise B-INCORRECT
canoeing O
. O
You O
are O
likely O
feel O
scared O
at O
first O
but O
your O
confidence O
built O
up O
quickly O
due O
the O
constant O
support O
of O
teachers O

One O
of O
the O
last O
activities O
offered O
by O
centre O
was O
diving O
. O

I O
felt O
so O
overwhelmed O
that O
had O
to O
give O
it O
up O
, O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
want O
miss O
out O
this B-INCORRECT
great O
opportunity O
too O
trust O
your O
trainers O
since O
they O
are O
highly O
qualified O
. O

To O
sum O
up O
, O
I O
strongly B-INCORRECT
believe O
that O
you O
will O
have O
a B-INCORRECT
great O
time O
there O
and O
guarantee O
all O
the O
teachers O
meet O
with O
safety O
rules O
so O
enjoy O
lot O
without O
getting O
yourself O
into O
trouble O
. O

For O
all O
these O
reasons O
, O
this O
centre O
's O
really O
worth O
a O
visit O

Write O
soon O
and O
let O
me O
know O
if O
you O
need O
to O
anything O
else O
. O

With O
best O
wishes O
: B-INCORRECT

Sara O
. O

I O
felt O
so O
excited O
when O
looked O
at O
the O
envelope O
on O
desk O
of B-INCORRECT
my O
room O
. O

I O
checked O
the O
address O
as O
quickly O
could O
and O
realized O
that O
was O
right O
, O
it O
from O
Paris O
... O

My O
mother O
had O
written O
me B-INCORRECT
after O
months O
! O

Since O
she O
left O
to B-INCORRECT
Paris O
last O
year O
I B-INCORRECT
had O
been O
living O
in O
the O
school O
residence O
, O
which O
was O
n't O
cheerful O
at O
all O
what B-INCORRECT
made O
me O
feel O
really O
depressed O
. O

But O
I O
had O
her O
letter O
at O
last O
, O
so O
started O
to O
read O
it O
immediately O
. O

She O
told O
me O
that O
when O
I O
was O
on O
holidays O
had O
to O
buy O
myself O
a O
plane O
ticket O
Paris O
and O
go O
visit O
her O
for O
at O
least O
two O
months O
because O
she O
missing O
lot O
. O

It O
felt O
so O
good O
when O
I O
saw O
that O
my O
mother O
had O
n't O
forgotten O
me O
. O

I O
had O
never O
travelled O
to O
Europe O
yet B-INCORRECT
so B-INCORRECT
was O
really O
nervous O
too B-INCORRECT
, O
but O
it O
would O
be O
a O
great O
chance O
improve O
my O
French O
and O
spend O
lot O
of O
time O
with O
beloved O
mother O
in O
the O
city O
love O

Education O
is O
a O
milestone O
in O
our O
life O
and O
having O
good O
education O
the O
main O
door O
to O
labor O
market O
. O

Aware O
parents O
disappointed O
with O
educational O
systems O
and O
institutionalized O
education O
try O
to O
spot B-INCORRECT
in O
homeschooling O
a O
solution O
for B-INCORRECT
their O
children O
's O
. O

Although O
homeschooling O
may O
seem O
, O
according O
to O
some O
of O
these O
parents O
' O
opinions O
" O
a O
paved O
road O
it O

is O
a O
path O
not O
suitable O
for O
everybody O
's O
cars O
and B-INCORRECT
that O
compels O
us O
to O
seek O
other O
routes O
. O

Homeschooling O
should O
not O
be O
considered O
a O
wold B-INCORRECT
- O
wide O
phenomenon O
since B-INCORRECT
only O
few O
countries O
: O

lots O
of O
countries O
that O
do B-INCORRECT
not O

accept B-INCORRECT
homeschooling O
as O
a O
legal O
alternative O
so O
far O
and O
others O
where O
it O
is O
just O
an O
isolated O
happening B-INCORRECT
. O

The O
situation O
in O
Spain O
can O
be O
assessed O
as O
" B-INCORRECT
legal O
vacuum O
light O
of O
our O
constitutional O
right O
to O
free O

education O
meanwhile B-INCORRECT
attendance O
is O
compulsory O
in O
elementary O
and O
secondary O
. O

Educational O
and O
emotional O
freedom O
support O
this O
alternative O
way O
of O
learning O
. O

Homeschooling O
may O
also O
free O
up O
time O
for O
complementary O
activities O
such O
as O
music O
, O
sports O
and O
even O
the B-INCORRECT
family O
life O
. O

Homeschooled O
students O
' O
success O
has O
been O
backed O
up O
by O
the O
results O
on O
standardize B-INCORRECT
test B-INCORRECT
and O
recognition O
of O
prestigious O
universities O
. O

Now O
though O
, O
before O
homeschooling O
your O
kids O
you O
also O
have O
to O
consider O
the O
same O
amount O
of O
roadblocks O
: O

the O
lack O
of O
facilities O
or O
expertise O
, O
not O
enough O
socialization O
for O
your O
children O
ending O
up O
being O
a O
frustrated O
parent O
without O
money O
to O
make O
ends O
meet O
. O

As O
far O
as O
I B-INCORRECT
am O
concerned O
want O
to O
think O
about O
homeschooling O
a O
wake O
up B-INCORRECT
call O
for O
educational O

systems O
. O

However O
, O
homeschooling O
will O
never O
succeed O
if O
parents O
do O
not O
have O
the O
right O
skills O
. O

As O
traditional O
education O
seems O
to O
be O
exhausted O
, O
new O
technologies O
open O
up O
as O
" O
the O

solution O
" O
and O
blended O
learning O
is O
the O
future O
. O

Geographic B-INCORRECT
and O
natural O
environment O
around O
the O
building O
space O
, O
as O
well O
neighbourhood O
would B-INCORRECT
be B-INCORRECT
surely B-INCORRECT
taken O
into O
consideration O
while O
designing O
houses O
of O
future O
. O

Obviously O
, O
the O
future O
also O
indicates O
a O
home O
with O
more O
technology O
and O
very O
energy O
efficient B-INCORRECT
systems O
. O

In O
areas O
exposed O
to O
cataclysms B-INCORRECT
, O
such O
as O
earthquakes O
hurricanes O
and O
floods O
people O
should O
have O
their O
houses O
built O
of O
resistant O
materials O
. O

Steel O
or O
concrete O
structures O
would O
give O
the O
desired O
effect O
in O
this O
particular O
matter B-INCORRECT
. O

Environmentally O
friendly B-INCORRECT
buildings O
will O
be B-INCORRECT
definitely B-INCORRECT
on O
the O
drawing O
board O
. O

Built O
with B-INCORRECT
recyclable O
or O
recycled O
materials O
, O
the O
exterior O
surface O
of O
these O
houses O
should O
be O
ready O
to O
lit O
by O
daylight O
on O
sunny O
days O
not O
mention O
skylights O
and O
solar O
panels O
roofs O
which O
is B-INCORRECT
more O
popular O
even B-INCORRECT
. O

Moreover O
, O
solar O
energy O
collectors O
ought O
to O
be O
controlled O
by O
computers O
in O
order O
maximise O
comfort O
and O
efficiency O
. O

Urban O
housing O
issues O
( O
such O
as O
population O
growth O
) O
will O
be O
solved O
by O
exploiting O
some O
new O
areas O
. O

Maybe O
it O
's O
building O
castles O
in O
the O
air O
, O
but O
houseboats O
and O
apartments O
situated O
above O
city O
streets O
seem O
to O
be O
a O
perfect O
solution O
use O
up O
space O
that O
would O
otherwise O
wasted O
. O

Although O
people O
would B-INCORRECT
keep O
mulling O
over O
how O
to O
modernize O
their O
fancy O
houses O
( O
and O
bragging O
about O
it O
neighbours O
) O
, O
they O
will O
still O
need O
a O
warm O
cosy O
bed O
nice O
cup O
of O
tea O
. O

I O
suppose O
that O
will O
never O
change O
, O
even O
if O
they O
live O
in O
a O
concrete O
ivory O
tower O
. O

Catch O
it O
or O
lose O

The O
alpha O
and O
the O
omega O
of O
a O
good O
team O
is O
trust O
. O

That O
's O
the O
most O
important O
point O
if O
you O
want O
to O
play O
handball O
. O

You O
must O
be O
able O
to O
throw O
the O
ball O
blindly O
your O
teammate O
and O
he O
has O
catch O
it O
. O

Otherwise O
the O
opponent O
will O
have O
chance O
to O
get O
a O
point O
. O

Are O
you O
a O
real O
team O
player O
? O

Handball O
is O
one O
of O
the O
most O
dynamic O
sports O
in O
this O
world O
. O

Over O
eighty O
points O
can O
be O
made O
all O
together O
in O
sixty O
minutes O
, O
if O
not O
even O
more O
. O

This O
shows O
how O
rapidly O
the O
game O
can O
change O
. O

One O
lost O
ball O
can O
make O
your O
team O
the O
loser O
of O
game O
. O

I O
started O
to O
play O
handball O
when O
was O
5 O
years O
old O
. O

At O
first O
, O
it O
was O
only O
a O
hobby O
but O
with O
the O
years O
became O
passion B-INCORRECT
. O

What O
I O
love O
most O
about O
this O
sport O
is O
, B-INCORRECT
the O
speed O
and O
unconditional O
team O
spirit O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
practise B-INCORRECT
handball O
, O
just O
be O
sure O
that O
have O
a O
good O
team O
and O
do O
n't O
forget O
the O
fun O
! O

Triathlon O
: O
A O
famous O
sport O
throughout O
the O
world O

It O
seems O
as O
if O
, O
recently O
society O
has O
become O
more O
conscious O
of O
the O
importance O
practising B-INCORRECT
a O
sport O
. O

Clearly O
, O
this O
is O
a O
consequence O
of B-INCORRECT
the O
extra O
hours O
we O
have O
to O
work O
per O
day O
and O
as B-INCORRECT
way O
relaxing O
find O
doing O
sport O
an O
effective O
taking O
stress O
our O
bodies O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
we O
can O
see O
many O
people O
jogging O
and O
cycling O
these O
days O
whether B-INCORRECT
it O
is B-INCORRECT
in O
the O
morning O
before O
going O
to O
work O
or O
even O
after O
. O

Despite O
these O
two O
being O
the O
most O
popular O
sports O
amongst O
atlets B-INCORRECT
, O
many O
more O
are O
just O
as O
interesting O
and O
profitable B-INCORRECT
. O

One O
of O
them O
is O
triathlon O
, O
which O
my O
favourite O
sport O
. O

It O
consists O
of O
a O
mixture O
between B-INCORRECT
three O
different O
sports O
, O
swimming O
cycling O
and O
jogging O
as B-INCORRECT
result O
it B-INCORRECT
can O
be O
extremely O
demanding O
. O

What O
I O
enjoy O
most O
about O
it O
is O
being O
able O
to O
practise B-INCORRECT
anywhere O
, O
which O
means O
can O
do O
near O
home B-INCORRECT
instead O
of O
having O
go O
a O
sports O
center O
. O

It O
also O
means O
I O
can O
choose O
the O
location O
that O
most O
pleases O
me O
and O
therefore O
fully O
enjoy O
time O
spent O
doing O
it O
. O

Triathlon O
has O
become O
more O
popular O
over O
the O
past O
few O
years O
and O
people O
are O
eager O
to O
try O
it O
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
is B-INCORRECT
crucial O
to O
understand O
that O
improving O
in O
such O
a O
demanding O
sport O
requires O
time O
and O
important O
establish O
some O
goals O
order O
keep O
motivated O
. O

You O
must O
not O
push O
yourself O
too O
far B-INCORRECT
. O

A O
gap O
year O
between O
school O
and O
college O
sounds O
a O
great O
idea O
for O
those O
that O
have O
not O
decided O
what O
they O
want O
to O
study O
. O

However O
there B-INCORRECT
are O
some O
questions O
whether B-INCORRECT
it O
should O
be O
everyone B-INCORRECT
or O
not O
. O

First O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to O
put O
the O
arguments O
in O
favour O
of O
year O
off O
. O

Not O
everybody O
has O
the O
financial O
possibilities O
to O
pay O
for O
college O
, O
so O
taking O
a O
gap O
year O
earn O
money O
help O
with O
bills O
it B-INCORRECT
is O
time O
well O
spend B-INCORRECT
. O

But O
that O
it B-INCORRECT
is O
not O
the O
only O
reason O
to O
take O
a O
year O
off O
. O

Most O
of B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
people O
think O
that O
this O
year O
is O
to B-INCORRECT
travel B-INCORRECT
other O
countries O
and O
spend B-INCORRECT
all O
your O
time O
at O
parties O
, O
but O
not O
true O
you O
can O
develop O
culture O
do O
volunteer O
work O
so O
become O
a O
better O
person O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
many O
teens O
who O
take O
a O
year O
off O
end O
up O
to B-INCORRECT
spend B-INCORRECT
it O
in O
wrong O
way O
. O

For O
example O
, O
things O
might O
gone B-INCORRECT
not B-INCORRECT
as O
they O
had O
expected O
for O
multiple O
reasons O
such B-INCORRECT
having O
enoff B-INCORRECT
money O
or O
getting O
a O
job O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
people O
should O
take O
a O
year O
off O
but O
only O
when O
they O
have O
all B-INCORRECT
planed B-INCORRECT
and O
know O
for O
shore B-INCORRECT
that O
the O
possibility O
to O
do O
something O
useful O
with O
their O
time O
. O

" O
Farmer O
Giles O
of O
Ham O
is O
a O
fantasy O
story O
written O
by O
J.R.R. O
Tolkien O
. O

Set O
in O
England O
the O
first O
centuries O
of O
Middle O
Ages O
, O
story O
is O
about O
adventures O
Giles O
a O
farmer O
village O
Ham O
who B-INCORRECT
becomes O
hero O
against O
his O
wishes O
by O
defeating O
giant O
. O

When O
the O
dragon O
Chrysophylax O
comes O
and O
devastates O
everything O
, O
he O
is O
sent O
twice O
against O
him O
not O
only O
managing O
to O
defeat O
thanks O
magic O
sword O
Tailbiter O
but O
also O
obtaining O
a O
huge O
treasure O
. O

At O
the O
end O
of O
story O
, O
Giles O
becomes O
an O
independent O
king O
. O

I O
liked O
a B-INCORRECT
lot B-INCORRECT
this B-INCORRECT
story B-INCORRECT
firstly O
because B-INCORRECT
love O
fantasy O
stories O
, O
especially O
Tolkien O
's B-INCORRECT
ones O
: O
they O
bring B-INCORRECT
me O
to O
another O
universe O
making O
forget O
every B-INCORRECT
day B-INCORRECT
life O
. O

Secondly O
it B-INCORRECT
is O
very O
original O
because B-INCORRECT
a O
sort O
of O
parody O
traditional O
legends O
: O
the O
hero O
an O
ordinary O
person O
, O
knights O
reveal B-INCORRECT
fearful O
and O
incompetent O
clashes O
are O
won O
with O
words O
instead O
weapons O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
this O
story O
to O
everybody O
because B-INCORRECT
it O
is O
funny O
and O
adventurous O
Tolkien O
's O
ironic O
style O
, O
based O
also O
on O
the O
comical O
use O
of O
Latin O
words O
makes O
extremely O
pleasant O
read O
. O

Dear O
Sir O
or O
Madam O
, O

I O
am O
writing O
this O
letter O
to O
apply O
for O
the O
position O
in O
USA B-INCORRECT
Summer O
Camp B-INCORRECT
that O
saw O
advertised O

I O
am O
interested O
in O
working O
the B-INCORRECT
Educational B-INCORRECT
Institutions B-INCORRECT

In O

we B-INCORRECT
had O
to O

one O
year O
of O
volunteering O
in O
Youth B-INCORRECT
Supervising B-INCORRECT

, O
so O
I O
am O
able O
be O
a O
member O
your O
well B-INCORRECT
skilled O
staff O
. O

Since O
I O
was O
13 O
years O

, O
have O

Does O
traveling O
broaden O
your O
mind O
? O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
travelling O
does O
broaden O
your O
mind O
. O

When O
visit B-INCORRECT
different O
places O
, O
you O
get O
to O
see O
environments O
cultures O
people O
and O
even O
languages O
. O

Travelling O
helps O
you O
to O
develop O
as O
a O
person O
in O
many O
ways O
. O

For O
example O
, O
if O
you O
learn O
another O
language O
different O
from O
your O
own O
one O
even O
it O
is O
just O
a O
few O
basic O
sentences O
can O
communicate O
with O
people O
regions O
and O
improve O
confidence O
. O

Travelling O
also O
helps O
to O
see O
the O
way O
in O
which O
other O
people O
live O
, O
that O
your O
of O
living O
is O
not O
only O
one O
exists O
. O

This O
can O
help O
you O
to O
understand O
that O
not O
everyone O
has O
acces B-INCORRECT
many O
things O
do O
have O
too B-INCORRECT
, O
and O
realise O
perhaps O
should O
appreciate O
these O
such O
as O
smartphones B-INCORRECT
computers O
cars O
or O
even O
fresh O
water O
which O
is O
a O
basic O
resource O
we O
tend O
take O
for O
granted O
some O
drink O
though O
this O
true O
. O

Besides O
, O
when O
we B-INCORRECT
travel O
to O
different O
places O
see O
there O
are O
many O
cultures O
that O
differ O
greatly O
from O
our O
own O
culture O
and O
how O
one O
another O
humans O
. O

For O
all O
of O
these O
reasons O
I O
think O
travelling O
really O
broadens O
your O
mind O
. O

I O
want O
to O
build O
my O
career O
as O
a O
fully O
fledged O
researcher O
and O
academician B-INCORRECT
. O

To O
fulfill O
this O
dream O
a B-INCORRECT
PhD O
degree O
would O
be O
the O
most O
essential O
footstep O
. O

I O
am O
mostly O
also O
interested O
to B-INCORRECT
pursue B-INCORRECT
my O
PhD O
on B-INCORRECT
Theoretical O
and O
Computational O
Chemistry O
. O

I O
have O
a O
plan O
to O
study O
of B-INCORRECT
the O
equilibrium O
properties O
condensed O
- O
phase O
systems O
. O

I O
would O
also O
like O
to O
carry O
out O
my O
PhD O
research O
in B-INCORRECT
the O
development O
of O
transition O
metal O
complexes O
which O
can O
be O
used O
as O
drugs O
against B-INCORRECT
several O
human O
diseases O
, O
cosmetics O
materials O
and O
photonic O
optoelectronic O
devices O
. O

I O
also O
find O
Analytical O
Chemistry O
and O
Environmental O
are O
the B-INCORRECT
interesting O
fields O
of O
because O
their O
numerous O
applications O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
possess O
the O
strong O
motivation O
and O
intellectual O
capability O
to O
build O
a O
career O
in O
one O
of O
previously O
mentioned O
fields O
. O

After O
my O
PhD O
, O
I O
will O
return O
to O
country O
and O
continue O
teaching O
as O
well O
research O
with O
students O
of O
University B-INCORRECT
Barisal O
. O

There O
is O
no O
future O
for O
public O
transport O
? O

The O
number O
of O
cars O
grow B-INCORRECT
up B-INCORRECT
rapidly O
, O
however B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
public O
transport O
is O
still O
in O
use O
. O

Especially O
in O
a B-INCORRECT
big O
cities O
, B-INCORRECT
where O
there O
are O
traffic O
jams O
the B-INCORRECT
public O
transport O
is O
becoming O
more O
and O
popular O
again O
. O

In O
some O
cities O
it B-INCORRECT
's O
even O
forbidden O
to O
drive O
through O
the O
city O
center O
without O
special O
permission O
, O
so O
there O
is O
no O
other O
solution O
than O
use B-INCORRECT
a B-INCORRECT
public O
transport O
. O

But O
what O
is O
more O
convenient O
- O
own B-INCORRECT
car O
or O
public O
transport O
? O

Well O
it B-INCORRECT
depends O
.... O
When O
you O
travel O
with B-INCORRECT
your O
own O
car O
are O
independent O
. O

You O
do O
not O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
the O
schedule O
- O
you O
are O
a B-INCORRECT
driver O
so B-INCORRECT
it O
's O
your O
decision O
whenever O
want O
go B-INCORRECT
or O
stay O
longer O
in O
some O
place O
. O

You O
can O
listen O
to O
your O
favorite O
music O
or O
radio B-INCORRECT
. O

You O
are O
the O
boss O
. O

However O
, O
as O
a O
driver O
you B-INCORRECT
always O
have O
to O
be O
careful O
and O
watch O
out O
on O
the O
route B-INCORRECT
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
travel O
from O
one O
place O
another O
see O
different O
places O
, O
your O
own O
car O
is O
the O
best O
solution O
. O

It O
allows O
you O
to O
see O
much O
more O
in B-INCORRECT
your O
pace B-INCORRECT
. O

But O
think O
about O
the O
costs O
. O

Think O
how O
much O
you O
pay O
for O
a O
petrol O
nowadays O
. O

Consider O
as B-INCORRECT
well O
how B-INCORRECT
many O
days O
do B-INCORRECT
you O
have O
for O
vacations O
. O

Maybe O
cheap O
airlines O
are O
better O
? O

Being B-INCORRECT
back O
to O
our O
everyday O
life O
. O

Most O
of O
us O
are O
living O
in O
a B-INCORRECT
big O
cities O
and O
face O
problems O
with O
the O
traffic O
. O

What O
if O
we O
use B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
public O
transport O
to O
get O
work O
? O

Well O
, O
then O
you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
worry O
about O
the B-INCORRECT
parking O
space O
and O
can O
read O
more O
books O
on O
way O
work O
. O

Simply O
, O
you O
can O
use O
the O
way B-INCORRECT
to O
work O
as O
an B-INCORRECT
additional O
time O
for O
yourself O
. O

What O
else O
? O

After O
work O
you O
can O
go O
for O
a O
drink O
with O
your O
colleagues O
! O

And O
if O
the O
ecology B-INCORRECT
is O
important O
for B-INCORRECT
you O
just B-INCORRECT
think O
about O
pollution O
. O

Let O
's O
reflect O
one B-INCORRECT
again O
: O
is O
there O
a O
future O
for O
public O
transport O
? O

In O
my O
opinion O
: O
yes O
, O
there O
is O
! O

Is O
travelling O
by O
car O
more O
convenient O
? O

Well O
, O
it O
depends O
! O

Why O
using B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
first O
narration B-INCORRECT
? O

The B-INCORRECT
first B-INCORRECT
narration O
can O
attract O
readers O
' O
attention O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
friction B-INCORRECT
and O
makes B-INCORRECT
get O
into O
thoughts O
madman O
easily O
. O

We O
ca O
n't O
understand O
what O
others O
think O
usually O
, O
but O
in O
this O
friction B-INCORRECT
the O
author O
invited O
us O
know B-INCORRECT
inside B-INCORRECT
madman O
's O
mind O
. O

Feeling O
that O
the O
main O
character O
is O
talking O
to O
us O
, O
as O
if O
we O
were O
all O
involved O
in O
this O
case O
whole O
thing O
seemed O
like O
really B-INCORRECT
happened O
. O

Facing O
the O
murder O
directly O
makes O
horror O
penetrates B-INCORRECT
into O
our O
hearts O
. O

How O
does O
the O
author O
create O
a O
word B-INCORRECT
of O
horror O
to B-INCORRECT
his O
readers O
? O

The O
author O
created O
the O
horrible B-INCORRECT
atmosphere O
by O
describing O
scene O
, O
disordered O
mind O
and O
sound O
of O
heartbeats O
. O

First O
, O
the O
scene O
that O
described O
murder O
makes O
readers O
ca B-INCORRECT
n't B-INCORRECT
help B-INCORRECT
themselves O
emerging B-INCORRECT
images O
in O
their O
mind B-INCORRECT
. O

Just O
like O
the O
madman O
's O
plan O
was O
happening O
right O
in O
front O
us B-INCORRECT
. O

Then O
comes O
to B-INCORRECT
the O
sound O
, O
heartbeats O
. O

To B-INCORRECT
my O
opinion O
, O
heartbeat B-INCORRECT
is O
the O
element O
that O
push B-INCORRECT
whole O
story O
to O
climax O
. O

Every O
time O
when B-INCORRECT
the O
sound O
of O
heartbeats O
started O
arousing B-INCORRECT
, O
something O
ensued O
. O

In B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
first O
time O
, O
when O
madman O
heard O
heartbeats O
of O
old O
man O
he O
was O
going O
to O
kill O
and O
did O
it O
. O

The O
second O
time O
when O
madman B-INCORRECT
heard O
the O
heartbeats O
, B-INCORRECT
he O
became O
impatient O
scared O
excited O
and O
insane O
in B-INCORRECT
end O
confessed O
that O
killed O
man O
dismembered O
corpse O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
heartbeats O
also O
dragged B-INCORRECT
readers O
nervous O
and O
anxious O
. O

Finally O
, O
I O
think O
the O
way O
author O
wanted O
to O
express O
disordered O
mind O
of O
madman O
is O
his O
intonation O
. O

The O
whole O
story O
except B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
end O
of O
friction B-INCORRECT
he O
confessed O
crime O
, O
madman O
's B-INCORRECT
used O
intonation O
that O
is O
extremely O
calm O
and O
steady O
to O
tell O
readers O
process O
cruel O
thing O
had O
done O
. O

The O
sharp O
contract B-INCORRECT
for B-INCORRECT
the O
calm O
and O
cruelty O
, O
leaves O
us O
a B-INCORRECT
strong O
impression O
that O
main O
character O
was O
totally O
insane O
crazy O
. O

Shivering O
inside O
our O
hearts O
, O
the O
horror O
increases O
. O

" O
Let O
's O
go O
to O
the O
forest O
see O
variety B-INCORRECT
of O
animals O
which O
are O
found O
there O
, O
Max O
told B-INCORRECT
his O
friends O
one O
sunny O
afternoon O
. O

When O
all O
was O
set O
, O
they O
started O
their O
trip O
to O
the O
forest O
. O

When O
they O
arrived O
there O
, O
started O
to O
look O
around O
trying O
find O
different O
types O
of O
animals O
such O
as O
birds O
rabbits O
and O
deer O
. O

Max O
and O
his O
friends O
took O
a O
walk O
under O
the O
trees O
when O
, O
acroos B-INCORRECT
river O
they O
saw O
something O
that O
looked O
like O
an O
animal O
lying O
on O
grass."What O
's O
? O
" O
said O
aloud O
. O

They O
ran O
quickly O
, O
crossed O
the O
river O
and O
they O
reached O
place O
where O
animal O
was."It O
's O
a O
deer O
! B-INCORRECT
its O
leg O
is O
in O
trap O
" B-INCORRECT
Max O
friend O
shouted O
. O

When O
they O
saw O
the O
animal O
, O
could O
see O
that O
it O
was O
suffering O
so O
decided O
to O
free O
deer O
. O

By B-INCORRECT
this O
decision O
, O
Max O
took B-INCORRECT
courage O
to O
open O
the O
trap O
but O
deer O
did O
n't O
move O
because O
its O
leg O
was O
injured O
. O

One O
of O
Max O
's O
friend B-INCORRECT
brought O
water O
from O
the O
river O
to O
give O
deer O
. O

Max O
cut O
a O
piece O
of O
his O
T O
- O
shirt O
to O
cure B-INCORRECT
the O
animal O
. O

Afterwards O
, O
the O
animal O
was O
better O
and O
it O
walked O
away O
slowly O
. O

When O
the O
day O
finished O
, O
Max O
and O
his O
friends O
returned O
home O
feeling O
happy O
because O
they O
had O
saved O
animal O
's O
life."What B-INCORRECT
an O
amazing O
! O
" O
whispered O
to O
himself O
as O
he O
got O
into O
bed O
that O
night O
. O

The O
question O
is O
: O
whether O
it O
possible O
to O
be O
famous O
without O
journalists O
? O

Probably O
not O
, O
but O
they B-INCORRECT
are O
many O
people O
in O
show O
- B-INCORRECT
busines B-INCORRECT
or O
political O
life O
who O
ready O
to O
do O
everything O
save O
their O
private O
. O

Generally O
, O
people O
may O
be O
famous O
for O
two O
reasons O
: O
because O
of O
their O
job O
or O
scandalising B-INCORRECT
private O
life O
. O

If O
you O
decide O
to O
became O
famous O
because O
of O
your O
scandalising B-INCORRECT
private O
life O
, O
it O
would O
be O
silly O
complain O
about O
tiring O
paparazzi O
. O

There O
is O
a O
rule O
, O
probably O
one O
of O
the O
most O
important O
in O
public O
life O
that O
says O
more O
or O
less O
: O
' O
It O
not O
what O
are B-INCORRECT
they B-INCORRECT
talking B-INCORRECT
about O
you O
it O
. O

Most O
of B-INCORRECT
celebrities O
follow O
this O
rule O
, O
as O
it O
is O
just O
what O
they O
are O
living O
for O
. O

That O
is O
why O
they O
are O
often O
able O
to O
sell O
information O
about O
their O
private O
life O
. O

Real B-INCORRECT
problem O
starts O
when O
journalists O
injures B-INCORRECT
not O
the O
celebrity O
, O
but O
its B-INCORRECT
friends O
or O
family O
. O

Paparazzi O
are O
cruel O
in B-INCORRECT
contact O
with O
famous O
people O
's O
children O
, O
that B-INCORRECT
may O
have O
negative B-INCORRECT
influence O
on O
their O
emotional O
development O
. O

How O
about O
those O
who O
do O
not O
want O
to O
be O
popular O
because O
of O
scandals O
? O

In O
most O
cases O
they B-INCORRECT
are O
just O
doing O
their O
job O
as O
well O
can O
, O
leading O
boring O
life O
. O

And O
when O
finally O
paparazzi O
notice O
that O
there O
is O
nothing O
interesting O
in O
their O
life O
, O
they O
just O
leave O
them O
alone O
. O

Summarizing O
, B-INCORRECT
I O
do O
believe O
that O
adult O
people O
are O
responsible O
enough O
to O
make O
a O
decision O
if B-INCORRECT
they O
want O
share O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
their O
life O
with O
journalists O
. O

And O
I O
hope O
they O
understand O
, O
their O
duty O
is O
to O
save B-INCORRECT
relatives O
. O

Great O
food O
is O
probably O
one O
of O
the O
most O
valuable O
pleasures O
life O
. O

As O
a O
person O
who O
loves O
to O
eat O
, O
I B-INCORRECT
consider O
environment B-INCORRECT
quality O
of O
food O
and O
price O
as O
the O
main O
factors O
decide O
where O
should B-INCORRECT
go O
. O

Last O
Friday O
I O
visited O
a O
brand O
new O
Mexican O
restaurant O
in O
Lisbon O
called O
" O
Las O
Ficheras O
. O

It O
was O
suggested O
by O
two O
friends O
of O
mine O
and O
according B-INCORRECT
to O
them O
, O
because O
the B-INCORRECT
good O
food O
funny B-INCORRECT
environment O
. O

I O
went O
to O
dinner O
with O
more B-INCORRECT
6 O
friends O
in O
order O
having B-INCORRECT
fun O
and O
eat O
good O
Mexican O
food O
after O
a O
stressful O
week O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
the O
food O
was O
good O
but B-INCORRECT
prices O
were O
too O
expensive O
considering O
quantity O
served O
and O
messy O
service O
. O

We O
faced O
continuous O
problems O
with O
the O
order O
such B-INCORRECT
as O
: O
dishes O
from O
another O
table O
served O
for B-INCORRECT
us O
by O
mistake O
, O
drinks O
were O
a O
considerable O
delay O
and O
bill O
was O
shown O
even O
without O
asking O
( O
just O
because O
we O
finished O
dinner O
but O
our O
still O
on O
) O
. O

For B-INCORRECT
my B-INCORRECT
luck B-INCORRECT
( O
or O
not O
) O
, O
I O
met O
a O
friend O
of O
mine O
on O
the O
day O
after O
that B-INCORRECT
told O
me O
she O
had O
dinner O
at O
" O
Las O
Ficheras O
before O
and O
in B-INCORRECT
her O
opinion O
as O
Mexican O
restaurant O
was O
terrible O
. O

She O
also O
told O
me O
that O
a O
great O
Mexican O
restaurant O
was B-INCORRECT
just O
opened O
with O
lower O
prices O
and O
good O
service O
. O

I O
got O
curious O
about O
this O
place O
and O
decided O
to O
go O
later O
. O

" O
Pistola O
y O
Corazón O
Taqueria O
was O
the O
first O
Mexican O
restaurant O
that B-INCORRECT
I O
could O
eat O
genuine O
food O
, O
with O
lower O
prices O
and O
a B-INCORRECT
great O
service O
. O

They O
served O
us O
" O
nachos O
with O
tomato O
sauce O
for O
free O
while O
we O
were O
choosing O
the O
main O
dishes O
. O

After O
choosing O
, O
a O
bottle O
of O
fresh O
water O
was O
served O
again O
for O
free O
. O

We O
chose O
" O
tacos O
of O
meat O
with O
guacamole O
sauce O
and O
it O
was O
absolutely O
delicious O
. O

After O
paying O
the O
bill O
, O
they O
offered O
us O
a O
shot O
of O
tequila O
to O
finish O
our O
visit O
confirming B-INCORRECT
that O
great O
places O
still O
exists B-INCORRECT
. O

Hey O
! O
I O
survived O
:) O

First O
of O
all O
: O
THANK O
YOU O
FOR O
YOUR O
TIME O
AND O
HELP O
WITH O
THE O
ARTICLE O
! O

Second O
of O
all O
, O
HOW O
ARE O
YOU O
? O

And O
also O
, O
where O
are O
you O
now O
? O
:) O

In O
my O
case O
... O
I O
'm O
much O
better O
now O
. O
settled O
back O
home O
and O
up O
running O
, O
even O
though O
uncured B-INCORRECT
sprained O
ankle O
has O
gone B-INCORRECT
worst B-INCORRECT

Last O
week O
I O
was O
borrowed B-INCORRECT
an O
ankle O
support O
and O
some O
crutches O
, O
so O
ever O
since O
then O
it O
's O
going O
better O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
precisely B-INCORRECT
today O
I O
have O
started O
my O
15-day O
rehabilitation O
sessions O
! O

So O
I O
should O
be O
back O
on B-INCORRECT
jumping O
around O
in O
no O
time O
:) O
. O

As O
you O
know O
, O
Malta O
was O
a O
big O
punch O
right O
in O
the O
stomach O
which O
for O
sure O
I O
did O
n't O
need O
! O
:( O
. O

The O
course O
and O
the O
organization O
left O
much O
to O
be O
desired O
; O
as O
if O
that O
were O
n't O
enough O
, O
my O
scholarship O
( O
funny O
not O
ones O
of O
only O
! O
) O
TWO O
other O
participants O
was O
sufficient O
cover O
all O
costs O
:/ O

Anyway O
, O
CS O
and O
magic O
saved O
me O
right O
at O
the O
last O
second O
( O
night O
) O
I O
left O
Malta O
with O
a O
smile O
warmed O
up O
heart O
. O

And O
for O
that O
I O
want O
to O
THANK O
YOU O
once O
again O
. O

Back O
home O
, O
everything O
started O
fast O
-I B-INCORRECT
should O
have O
gotten O
used O
to O
by O
now O
n't O
I??- O
. O

So O
I O
had B-INCORRECT
n't O
have O
time O
for O
much O
. O

I O
have O
been O
totally O
immerse B-INCORRECT
in O
looking O
for O
jobs O
and O
the O
translation O
of O
scientific O
paper O
a O
former O
student O
mine O
. O

He O
decided O
to O
finish O
the O
second O
half O
without O

so O
that O
was O
a O
bit O
disappointing O
both O
for O
feeling O
of O
not O
meeting O
his O
expectations O
* O
and O
( O
I O
'm O
guessing O
as O
do O
n't O
know O
anything O
yet O
:/ O
) O
less O

Sorry O

here O
" O
not O

his O

be O
substituted O
by O
another O
expression O

What O
I O
doubt B-INCORRECT
is O
the O
difference O
between O
this O
bunch O
: O
be O
good O
enough O
, O
measure O
up O
make O

of B-INCORRECT
the O
limitations O
for B-INCORRECT

its O

The O

article O
" O
World O

about O
to O
enter O
' O
uncharted O
territory O
as O
it O
passes O
1C O
of O

, O
published O
on O
the O
9th O
November O
2015 O
describes O
problems O
global O
. O

Referring B-INCORRECT
to O
scientists O
at O
the O
British O
Met O
Office O
, O
2015 O
is O
going O
be O
year O
when O
milestone O
of O
1C O
warming O
will O
broken B-INCORRECT
- O
caused O
by O
global O
which O
lead O
unknown O
consequences O
on B-INCORRECT
future O
. O

The O
World O
Meteorological O
Organization O
made O
known O
publicly O
that O
2015 O
has B-INCORRECT
been O
the O
hottest O
year O
on O
record O
as O
well O
it O
caused B-INCORRECT
more O
carbon O
dioxide O
average O
by O
burning O
fossil O
fuels O
. O

These O
problems O
just O
announced O
recently O
will O
be O
issues O
to O
talk O
about O
at O
the O
UN O
summit O
in O
Paris O
three O
weeks O
. O

Then O
, O
world O
leaders O
will O
be O
negotiating O
about O
cutting O
the O
increased O
carbon O
emissions O
coupled O
with O
El O

climate O
phenomenon O
. O

Stephen O
Belcher O
, O
director O
of B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
Met O
Office O
's O
Hadley O
Centre O
claims O
that O
humanity O
is O
to O
blame O
for O
climate O
changes O
as B-INCORRECT
rise O
temperature O
or O
catastrophe O
expected O
by O
scientists O
when O
global O
warming O
rises O
beyond O
2C. O
This O
opinion O
also O
represented O
British O
Secretary O
energy O
and O
change O
Amber O
Rudd O
who O
considers O
be O
one O
greatest O
problems O
in O
nowadays B-INCORRECT
' B-INCORRECT
politics B-INCORRECT
due O
its O
consequences O
on B-INCORRECT
economy O
security O
fight O
against O
poverty O
. O

She O
stands O
up O
for O
a O
global O
deal O
confirmed O
on B-INCORRECT
the O
UN O
summit O
by O
leading O
states O
and O
therefore O
these O
climate O
targets O
should O
be O
role B-INCORRECT
- B-INCORRECT
model O
other O
countries O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
climate O
scientist O
Ed O
Hawkins O
expects O
a O
continuation O
of O
global O
warming O
clarifying O
this O
statement O
with O
the O
example O
Central O
England O
which O
has O
warmed O
20% O
more O
than O
average O
. O

Global O
warming O
in O
general O
leads O
to O
more O
natural O
disasters O
as B-INCORRECT
flooding O
, O
heatwaves O
water O
stress B-INCORRECT
and O
loss O
of O
harvests O
. O

Facing O
these O
consequences O
, O
a O
4C O
warming O
would O
be O
even O
more O
damaging O
according B-INCORRECT
to O
Belcher O
. O

Despite O
the O
result O
of O
a O
NASA O
study O
pointing O
out O
that O
there O
would O
have O
been O
an O
ice O
mass O
grew B-INCORRECT
in O
Antarctica O
from O
2003 O
- O
2008 O
, O
is O
only O
small O
chance O
5 O
10% O
this O
prognosis O
will O
come O
true O
according O
to O
Prof O
Andrew O
Shepherd O
University O
Leeds O
as O
has O
already O
proven O
wrong O
by O
57 O
other O
studies O
. O

Although O
the O
NASA O
study O
shows O
a O
different O
result O
, O
majority O
of B-INCORRECT
scientists O
see O
global O
warming O
as B-INCORRECT
dangerous O
threat O
for B-INCORRECT
this O
planet O
in O
terms O
living O
conditions O
environment O
and O
economy O
well B-INCORRECT
an O
issue O
UN O
summit O
Paris O
. O

The O
problem O
lies O
in O
the O
outdated O
framework O
which O
IWC O
operates O
. O

Fifteen O
whaling O
nations O
formed O
the O
IWC O
after O
whale O
populations O
collapsed O
. O

The O
organisation O
was O
initially O
set O
up O
to O
conserve O
whales O
only O
the O
extent O
that O
they O
could O
continue O
be O
used O
by O
humans O
. O

The O
importance O
of O
World O
Heritage O
properties O
transcends O
national O
boundaries O
. O

Their O
qualities O
are O
extraordinary O
so O
that O
no B-INCORRECT
matter O
which O
country O
they O
found O
in O
, O
and O
who O
experiences O
them O
evoke O
a O
sense O
of O
wonder O
admiration O
. O

To O
be O
included O
on O
the O
World O
Heritage O
List O
, O
properties O
must O
of O
outstanding O
universal O
value O
and O
meet O
at O
least O
one O
ten O
selection O
criteria O
. O

The O
World O
heritage B-INCORRECT
list O
is O
important O
because O
it O
attracts O
tourists O
and O
these O
landmarks O
are O
cherished O
by O
everyone O
around O
the O
world O
. O

It O
is O
also O
protected O
by O
UNESCO O
because O
they O
have B-INCORRECT
found O
new O
animals O
or O
plants O
; O
there O
are O
endangered O
spices B-INCORRECT
in O
that O
area O
a O
significant O
importance O
history O
. O

World O
Heritage O
is O
the O
designation O
for O
places O
on O
Earth O
that O
are O
of O
outstanding O
universal O
value O
to O
humanity O
and O
as B-INCORRECT
such O
, O
have O
been O
inscribed O
List O
be O
protected O
future O
generations O
appreciate O
enjoy O
. O

The O
site O
is O
the O
property O
of O
country O
on O
whose O
territory O
it O
located O
, O
but O
considered O
in O
interest O
international O
community O
to O
protect O
for O
future O
generations O
. O

Its O
protection O
and O
preservation O
becomes O
a O
concern O
of O
the O
international O
World O
Heritage O
community O
as O
whole O
. O

Another O
advantage O
for B-INCORRECT
a O
site O
to O
be B-INCORRECT
inscribed O
on O
the O
List O
is O
that O
once O
country O
signs O
Convention O
, O
and O
has O
sites O
World O
Heritage O
; B-INCORRECT
resulting O
prestige O
often O
helps O
raise O
awareness O
among O
citizens O
governments O
heritage O
preservation O
. O

Greater O
awareness O
leads O
to O
a O
general O
rise O
in O
the B-INCORRECT
level O
of O
protection O
and O
conservation O
given O
heritage O
properties O
. O

A O
country O
may O
also O
receive O
financial O
assistance O
and O
expert O
advice O
from O
the O
World O
Heritage O
Committee O
to O
support O
activities O
for O
preservation O
of O
its O
sites O
. O

The O
Disadvantages B-INCORRECT
of O
sites O
not O
included O
in B-INCORRECT
the O
World O
Heritage O
List O
are O
that O
these O
funded O
so O
they O
ca O
n't O
protect O
them O
for O
risks O
. O

Moreover O
they B-INCORRECT
remind B-INCORRECT
in B-INCORRECT
the O
list O
of O
sites O
danger O
without O
to B-INCORRECT
receive B-INCORRECT
assistance O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
the B-INCORRECT
sites O
in O
danger O
unless B-INCORRECT
they O
not B-INCORRECT
answer B-INCORRECT
at B-INCORRECT
ten O
criteria O
should B-INCORRECT
be O
protect O
for B-INCORRECT
UNESCO O
. O

It O
's O
difficult O
, O
but O
I O
think O
that O
it O
is O
necessary O
try B-INCORRECT
to O
invent O
new O
way B-INCORRECT
finance O
and O
defend O
the O
natural O
cultural O
heritage O
. O

Cricket O
is O
my O
passion O
. O

I O
love O
playing O
, O
watching O
and O
talking O
about O
it O
. O

It O
's O
my O
first O
passion O
and O
I O
am B-INCORRECT
following O
it O
as B-INCORRECT
far O
earliest O
memory O
goes O
. O

Cricket O
is O
a O
team O
sport O
which O
teaches O
us O
work O
, O
collaboration O
and O
strict O
discipline O
. O

It O
also O
teaches O
us O
how O
to O
overcome O
individual O
weaknesses O
and O
gain B-INCORRECT
advantage O
of O
others O
strength B-INCORRECT
succeed O
as O
a O
team O
. O

I O
started O
playing O
cricket O
since B-INCORRECT
my O
early O
childhood O
. O

Even O
when O
I B-INCORRECT
was O
a O
kid O
started O
playing O
with O
boys O
of B-INCORRECT
much B-INCORRECT
higher B-INCORRECT
age B-INCORRECT
than O
me O
. O

It O
gave O
me O
a O
lot O
of O
confidence O
and O
chance O
to O
improve O
my O
skills O
rapidly O
. O

I O
followed O
cricket O
religiously O
and O
have O
watched O
almost O
every O
match O
India O
played O
. O

Sachin O
Tendulkar O
is O
my O
favorite O
cricketer O
. O

I O
am O
fan B-INCORRECT
of O
his O
batting O
. O

He O
has O
broken O
almost O
every O
record O
in O
cricket O
history O
. O

Apart O
from O
his O
cricketing O
skills O
I B-INCORRECT
loved B-INCORRECT
ability O
to O
handle O
pressure O
and O
calm O
nature O
in O
all O
situations O
. O

If O
someone O
wants O
to O
learn O
more O
about O
cricket O
I B-INCORRECT
will B-INCORRECT
advise O
him O
watch O
batting B-INCORRECT
of O
great B-INCORRECT
like O
Sachin O
, O
Dravid O
Lara O
and O
Pointing O
. O

To O
learn O
more O
about O
bowling O
one B-INCORRECT
should O
watch O
Akram O
, O
Warne O
and O
Murli O
. O

I O
will B-INCORRECT
also O
advise O
reading O
more O
about O
cricket O
on O
cricinfo.com O
. O

It O
has O
nice O
articles O
, O
reviews O
and O
statistics O
on O
many O
players O
games O
. O

Reading O
biographies O
of O
some O
famous O
cricketers O
will O
also O
help O
to B-INCORRECT
understand O
the O
insights O
game O
in O
deep B-INCORRECT
. O

Cricket O
is O
going O
through O
rough B-INCORRECT
phase O
due O
to O
match O
fixing O
and O
betting O
scandals O
. O

But O
I O
am O
sure O
it O
will O
come O
strong B-INCORRECT
out B-INCORRECT
of B-INCORRECT
this B-INCORRECT
and O
spread O
its O
wings O
all O
across O
the O
world O
once O
again O
give O
lovers B-INCORRECT
a O
magnificent O
show O
. O

I O
met O
a O
friend O
about O
one O
week O
ago O
, O
and O
he O
asked O
me O
question O
that O
ca O
n't O
stop O
thinking O
: O
What B-INCORRECT
is O
on O
my O
Bucket O
List O
? O

I O
ca O
n't O
stop O
thinking O
about O
it O
, O
because O
realized O
that O
had O
never O
stopped O
to O
think O
my O
life O
in O
such O
a O
deep O
way O
. O

By O
the O
way O
, O
do O
you O
know O
what O
a O
Bucket O
List O
is O
? O

It O
is O
a O
list O
of O
things O
that O
you O
want O
to O
do O
before O
die O
. O

I O
think O
is B-INCORRECT
kind O
of O
sad O
, O
that O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
want O
to O
makes O
me O
truly O
happy O
. O

About O
two O
weeks O
before O
I B-INCORRECT
met O
him O
watched O
a O
very O
beautiful O
movie O
called O
" O
The O
fault O
in O
our O
stars O
. O

It O
's O
about O
a O
teen O
couple O
who O
are O
diyng B-INCORRECT
because B-INCORRECT
of O
cancer O
, O
and O
they O
have O
different O
ways O
to B-INCORRECT
think B-INCORRECT
life O
death O
. O

This O
movie O
has B-INCORRECT
touched O
me O
very O
deeply O
, O
it O
made O
think O
about O
life O
and O
the O
way O
people O
used B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
live O
without O
apprecciate B-INCORRECT
really O
important O
things O
. O

So O
after B-INCORRECT
watching O
this O
movie O
and O
my O
friend O
's O
question O
I O
ca O
n't O
help O
thinking O
about O
life O
. O

Now O
I O
have O
the O
feeling O
that O
need O
to O
live O
more B-INCORRECT
, O
but O
no O
idea O
what O
is B-INCORRECT
this B-INCORRECT
" B-INCORRECT
. O

Before O
that O
I B-INCORRECT
had O
always O
thought O
about O
getting O
married O
and O
having O
kids O
as O
a O
way O
to O
find O
happiness O
, O
but O
now O
think O
before B-INCORRECT
this O
need O
do O
other O
things O
. O

It O
is O
very O
interesting O
to O
think O
that O
it O
was O
necessary O
meet B-INCORRECT
someone O
new O
, O
from O
another O
entire B-INCORRECT
different O
culture O
make O
me O
about O
what O
I O
want O
. O

It O
is O
very O
strange O
that O
another O
person O
became O
curious O
about O
a O
profound O
part O
of O
me O
I O
have O
never O
thought O
. O

Well O
, O
next O
November O
I O
will O
travel O
to O
Europe O
the O
only O
certain O
thing O
on O
my O
Bucket O
List O
that O
know O
. O

However O
, O
now O
I O
have O
an O
awful O
feeling O
about O
what O
am O
doing O
today O
because O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
my O
life O
sure O
that O
need O
change B-INCORRECT
something O
and O
think O
this B-INCORRECT
" O
is O
almost O
everything O
. O

Peoples O
lives O
will O
change O
in O
the O
future O
, O
and O
I O
bet O
it O
's O
not O
for O
better O
. O

Unlike O
popular O
understandings O
of O
History O
( O
and O
even O
presumably O
scientific O
ones O
, O
I O
must O
say O
) O
is O
not O
an O
unstoppable O
march O
towards O
" O
progress O
whatever O
that O
word O
means O
. O

It O
is O
a O
ciclical B-INCORRECT
process O
. O

Rome O
had O
its O
hayday B-INCORRECT
in O
the O
first O
century O
AD O
, O
but O
just O
three O
centuries O
later O
it B-INCORRECT
was O
only O
a O
shadow O
of O
past O
. O

Those O
later O
period O
Romans O
were O
n't O
even O
able O
to O
make O
the O
high O
quality O
cement O
that O
their O
ancestors O
and O
have O
technical O
mastery O
over O
just O
a O
few O
centuries O
earlier O
. O

And O
who O
can O
safely O
say O
that O
three O
centuries O
from O
now O
humans O
will O
possess O
all O
the O
technological O
knowledge O
they O
and O
take O
for O
granted O
? O

No O
one O
can O
assure B-INCORRECT
such O
a O
thing O
. O

But O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
, O
unless O
there O
's O
another O
World O
War O
people O
lives O
will O
change O
dramatically O
in O
the O
next O
50 O
years O
. O

I O
think O
in O
the O
next O
50 O
years O
age O
of O
technology O
will O
have O
its O
peak O
, O
and O
after O
that O
there O
be O
a O
decline O
until O
new O
Dark O
Ages B-INCORRECT
. O

But O
let O
's O
pick O
the B-INCORRECT
World O
War O
hypothesis O
for O
a O
second O
. O

A O
wide B-INCORRECT
world B-INCORRECT
war O
is O
the O
only O
case O
in O
which O
we O
would O
see O
a O
dramatic O
change O
peoples O
lives O
time B-INCORRECT
length B-INCORRECT
of O
50 O
years O
from O
now O
. O

But O
there B-INCORRECT
's B-INCORRECT
, O
at B-INCORRECT
this B-INCORRECT
day B-INCORRECT
prospects O
for O
a O
new O
World O
War O
? O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
so O
, O
but O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
what B-INCORRECT
hell O
know O
? O

The O
causes O
that O
will O
lead O
to O
a O
new O
World O
War O
may O
well O
be O
in O
existence O
right O
now O
for O
all O
I O
know B-INCORRECT
, O
and O
no O
one O
or O
only O
few O
very O
wise O
intelligent O
people O
about O
it O
. O

One O
day O
in O
the O
future O
another B-INCORRECT
Franz O
Ferdinand O
could O
be O
killed O
, O
and O
that O
symbolic O
event O
serve O
again O
as O
an O
escuse B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
some O
country O
declare B-INCORRECT
war O
but O
true O
underlying O
causes O
actually O
led O
countries O
wage O
against O
each O
other O
would O
have O
its B-INCORRECT
roots O
much O
older O
times O
. O

As O
the O
causes O
of O
Second O
World O
War O
had O
its O
roots O
on B-INCORRECT
events O
that O
were O
outcome O
First O
, O
a O
Third O
hypothetical O
war O
could O
have O
past O
conflict O
may O
well O
happenned B-INCORRECT
already O
. O

But O
let O
's O
not O
digress O
into O
that B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
all O
another O
topic O
falls O
beyond O
the O
scope O
of O
statement O
on O
which O
I O
was O
supposed O
to O
write O
a O
composition O

In O
this O
Camp O
parents B-INCORRECT
are O
calm O
and O
do O
n't O

about O
their O
children O
because O
they O
in O
the O
care O
of O
a O
large O
number O
assistants O
camp O
is O
situated O
on O
an O
entire O
island O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
the O
site O
was O
purpose O
built O
to O
provide O
places O
fit O
for O
young O
people O
allowing B-INCORRECT
them O

lots O
of O
activities O

. O

There O
are O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
activities O
promoted O
by O
the O

Simonetta O

The O
doorbell O
rang O
unexpectedly O
. O
I O
had O
fallen O
asleep O
on O
the O
couch O
watching O
TV O

I O
got O
up O
and O
made O
my O
way O
to O
the O
front O
door O
. O

Outside O
stood O
the O
most O
extraordinary O
- O
looking O
man O
: O
he O
looked O
like O
a O
Spanish O
elephant O
hunter O
. O

I O
was O
taken O
aback O
, O
so O
called O
my O
mother O
who O
asleep O
with O
her O
boyfriends O
. O

She O
came O
down O
, O
but O
she O
did O
not O
scream O
. O

Instead O
she O
started O
crying O
. O

The O
man O
as B-INCORRECT
it O
turned O
out O
was B-INCORRECT
my O
father O
, O
who O
had O
been O
missing O
for O
15 O
years O
... O

I O
did O
not O
know O
that O
he O
was O
still O
alive O
. O

Mother O
had O
always O
told O
me O
he O
died O
in O
the O
war O
. O

I O
think O
she O
did O
this O
for O
my O
own O
good O
. O

I O
was O
very O
bemused O
by O
the O
situation O
and O
did O
n't O
know O
if O
liked O
him O
or O
not O
. O

In O
my O
dreams O
I O
had O
seen O
him O
as O
an O
intellectual O
but O
now O
he O
was O
in O
sitting O
room O
and O
looked O
like O
elephant O
or O
something O
exotic O
. O

It O
was O
very O
odd O
to O
see O
him O
in O
my O
home O
. O

Now O
we O
all O
live O
together O
. O

Although O
the O
first O
days O
were O
difficult O
, O
now O
we O
all O
get O
on O
well O
. O

It O
is O
great O
to O
be O
a O
whole O
family O
again O
. O

The O
Grand O
Place O
is O
the O
central O
square O
of O
Brussels O
. O

It O
is O
surrounded O
by O
several O
old O
buildings O
such O
as O
the O
city O
hall O
and O
of O
corporations O
Middle O
Ages O
. O

These O
were O
groups O
of O
people O
doing O
the O
same O
work O
, O
such O
as O
carpenters O
. O

They O
helped O
each O
other O
and O
the O
elders B-INCORRECT
ones O
taught O
youngsters O
. O

Sometimes O
, O
they O
became O
very O
rich O
. O

Each O
building O
is O
decorated O
with O
the O
blazon O
of O
corporation O
. O

Their O
architecture O
is O
unique O
and O
beautiful O
. O

Today O
, O
most O
of O
them O
are B-INCORRECT
hosting B-INCORRECT
cafés O
shops O
and O
restaurants O
that O
attracts B-INCORRECT
a O
lot O
tourists O
but O
there O
is O
also O
the O
city O
museum O
. O

The O
square O
is O
covered O
with O
pavement O
and O
a O
pedestrianized O
area O
. O

It O
is O
an O
important O
place O
for O
the B-INCORRECT
history O
because O
it O
oldest O
Grand O
Place O
of B-INCORRECT
Europe O
and O
a O
part O
neighbourhood O
Brussels O
which B-INCORRECT
made O
narrow O
paved O
streets O
, O
old O
high B-INCORRECT
buildings O
among O
other O
things O
chocolate O
shops O
. O

Recently O
, O
several O
of O
the O
buildings O
have O
been O
restored O
and B-INCORRECT
we O
can O
now O
better B-INCORRECT
see B-INCORRECT
their B-INCORRECT
beautiful B-INCORRECT
gilding B-INCORRECT
carvings B-INCORRECT
. O

Every O
year O
, O
when O
Christmas O
comes O
there O
is O
an O
amazing O
show O
with O
music O
and O
lights O
on O
the O
façades O
of O
buildings O
while O
a O
huge O
fir O
tree O
placed O
in O
centre O
square O

Wawel O
Royal O
Castle O
is O
one O
of O
the O
highest O
ranked O
monuments O
in O
history O
and O
culture O
Poland O
Europe O
, O
so O
during O
stay O
it O
necessary O
to O
visit O
. O

The O
first O
Castle O
, O
called O
palatium O
was O
built O
in O
11th B-INCORRECT
century O
the B-INCORRECT
remains O
of O
it O
are O
still O
visible O
inside O
walls O
. O

During O
the O
next O
centuries O
it O
was O
expanded O
, O
and O
in O
16th B-INCORRECT
century O
finally B-INCORRECT
rebuilt O
a O
Renaissance O
fashion B-INCORRECT
which O
remained B-INCORRECT
unchanged O
until O
today O
- O
most O
representative O
remnant O
is O
probably O
famous B-INCORRECT
arcaded O
coutyard B-INCORRECT
. O

During O
the B-INCORRECT
tour O
visitors O
are O
shown O
several O
room B-INCORRECT
and O
apartaments B-INCORRECT
, O
as O
well O
Royal B-INCORRECT
Private O
Apartaments B-INCORRECT
with O
far B-INCORRECT
- B-INCORRECT
famed B-INCORRECT
tapestries O
of O
Polish B-INCORRECT
' B-INCORRECT
kings O
collection B-INCORRECT
. O

Another O
attraction O
of O
the O
tour O
is O
visiting O
Crown O
Treasury O
, O
where O
Polish O
coronation O
insignia O
were O
stored O
and O
armoury B-INCORRECT
. O

Apart O
from O
the O
featured O
, O
there O
are O
also O
many O
marvellous O
exhibitions O
in O
Castle O
containing B-INCORRECT
its O
history O
as O
well O
other O
collections O
. O

While O
visiting O
Wawel O
Royal O
Castle O
one O
can B-INCORRECT
not O
omit B-INCORRECT
seeing O
Dragon O
's O
Den O
- O
a O
cave O
under O
the O
, O
where O
according O
to O
oldest O
legends O
dragon O
of O
lived O
. O

I O
recommend O
visiting O
Wawel O
Royal O
Castle O
because O
of O
its O
beauty O
and O
uniqueness O
. O

It O
is O
a O
symbol O
of O
thousand O
years O
the B-INCORRECT
Polish O
history O
and O
culture O
. O

Everyone O
will O
find O
something O
interesting O
among O
the O
variety O
of O
exhibitions O
and O
tours O
, O
for O
certain O
it B-INCORRECT
be O
a O
memorable O
experience O
. O

I O
have O
been O
learning O
English O
as O
a O
second O
language O
since O
was O
ten O
years O
old O
, O
which O
means O
very O
long O
time O
ago O
. O

I O
think O
am O
very O
lucky O
then O
because B-INCORRECT
have O
had O
the O
opportunity O
of O
learning O
English O
in O
a O
natural O
way O
, O
without O
books O
and O
tough O
lessons O
. O

My O
teachers O
thought O
it O
was O
better O
to O
learn O
by O
speaking O
, O
singing O
and O
doing O
other O
activities O
in O
English O
a O
way O
similar O
how O
we O
our O
own O
mother O
language B-INCORRECT
. O

Moreover O
, O
I O
travelled O
to O
England O
and O
lived O
with O
English O
families O
for O
a O
few O
weeks O
every O
summer O
since B-INCORRECT
started O
learning O
until O
was O
fifteen O
years O
old O
. O

So O
I O
grew O
up O
thinking O
could O
speak O
and O
write O
quite O
good O
English O
. O

Even O
though O
I O
do O
have O
little O
theoretical O
knowledge O
about B-INCORRECT
English O
grammar O
rules O
, O
can O
make O
myself O
understood O
in O
a O
normal O
conversation O
and O
write O
an O
email O
to O
friend O
without O
making O
too O
many O
mistakes O
. O

One O
year O
ago O
I B-INCORRECT
decided O
to O
take O
the O
Cambridge O
Advanced O
English O
exam O
in O
order O
test O
my O
knowledge O
, O
thinking O
It B-INCORRECT
would O
be O
not O
very O
difficult O
for O
me O
successful O
. O

I O
decided O
to O
enrol O
for O
a O
creative O
writing O
course O
in O
order O
practise O
my O
skills O
. O

Along B-INCORRECT
the O
course O
I O
had O
to O
accomplish O
some O
writing O
assignments O
and O
submit O
them O
be O
evaluated O
by O
my O
peers O
. O

And O
there O
I O
realised O
at O
least O
two O
things O
: O
the O
first O
one O
that B-INCORRECT
it O
is O
possible O
to O
learn O
how O
write O
better O
; O
second O
even O
when O
you O
can O
make O
yourself O
generally O
understood O
, O
It B-INCORRECT
not O
so O
easy O
be O
precise O
. O

A O
magician O
uses O
a O
dove O
and O
black O
hat O
, O
but O
it O
would O
n't O
be O
magic O
show O
if O
he O
did O
know O
how O
to O
perform O
the O
trick O
. O

In O
the O
same O
way O
I B-INCORRECT
had O
ideas O
and O
words O
but O
to O
admit O
that O
needed O
learn O
rules O
of O
grammar O
if O
wanted O
do O
magic O
trick O
precise O
stylish O
writing O
. O

Adolescence O
. O

Everybody O
say O
it O
's O
the O
best O
period O
in O
our O
whole O
life O
; O
what O
they O
do O
n't O
rembember B-INCORRECT
is O
that O
could B-INCORRECT
be B-INCORRECT
also B-INCORRECT
worst O
. O

Adolescence O
could B-INCORRECT
be O
compared O
to O
a O
foggy O
path O
and O
even B-INCORRECT
when O
it O
seems O
you O
can O
see O
something O
threw B-INCORRECT
, O
in O
reality O
do B-INCORRECT
n't O
. O

This O
awful O
fog O
is O
composed O
by B-INCORRECT
our O
uncontrolled O
emotions O
. O

Everything O
is O
unknown O
, O
but O
we O
try O
to O
pretend O
that O
know O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
. O

This O
could O
be O
one O
of O
the O
reason B-INCORRECT
why O
we O
get O
angry O
so O
easily O
and O
often O
with O
our O
parents O
: O
every O
time O
descover B-INCORRECT
something O
new O
or O
say O
, O
they O
judge O
us O
begin O
some O
long O
speeches O
to O
try O
change O
ideas O
. O

Another O
thing O
about O
the O
relationship O
between O
parents O
and O
adolescents O
is O
fact O
that O
they O
confuse O
our O
minds O
. O

As O
I O
said O
adolescents B-INCORRECT
could B-INCORRECT
be O
very O
confused O
and O
if O
there O
's O
a B-INCORRECT
thing O
that O
get B-INCORRECT
under O
our O
skinn B-INCORRECT
is B-INCORRECT
when O
moms O
say O
something O
then O
tell O
us O
to O
do O
the O
opposite O
one B-INCORRECT
. O

The O
worst O
part O
is O
that O
they O
get O
angry O
with O
us O
! O

We O
're O
confused O
, O
they O
not O
clear O
and B-INCORRECT
then O
also O
get O
angry O
surprised O
when O
we O
mad O
at O
them O
! O

It O
's O
true O
that O
we O
should O
always O
be O
respectful O
but B-INCORRECT
sometimes O
it O
turns O
out O
to O
impossible O
because B-INCORRECT
they O
do O
everything O
provoke O
us O
. O

I O
think O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
in O
relationship O
with O
our O
parents O
is O
to O
find O
a O
sort O
of O
accordance B-INCORRECT
, O
because O
end O
we O
do O
n't O
only O
feel O
anger O
for B-INCORRECT
them B-INCORRECT
but O
also O
lot O
love O
. O

Love O
: O
That B-INCORRECT
's O
a O
new O
feeling O
that O
adolescents O
have O
to O
face O
. O

It O
's O
not O
the O
usual O
love O
they O
're O
used O
to O
feel B-INCORRECT
, O
as B-INCORRECT
for O
family O
and O
friends O
but O
it O
a O
new O
kind O
of O
. O

It O
's O
a O
kind O
of O
love O
that O
struggles O
; O
it O
makes O
butterflies O
fly O
in O
our O
stomach O
, O
us O
dive O
into O
sort O
imaginary O
tale O
. O

That O
kind O
of O
love O
that O
we O
see O
in O
movies O
and O
dream O
; O
the O
type O
does O
n't O
make B-INCORRECT
us O
fall O
usleep B-INCORRECT
at O
night O
. O

It O
is O
a O
period O
in O
which O
we O
have O
our O
first O
experiences O
, O
and O
it O
as O
scary O
exciting B-INCORRECT
. O

Adolescence O
it B-INCORRECT
is O
like O
this O
, B-INCORRECT
there O
's O
a O
moment O
that O
looks O
magical O
and O
in O
the O
following O
one O
you O
drown O
into B-INCORRECT
dark O
. O

Dear O
group O
leader O
, O

First O
of O
all O
, O
I O
would O
like O
to B-INCORRECT
thank O
you O
for O
the O
interest O
shown O
our O
small O
village O
. O

I O
really O
hope O
that O
you O
have O
a O
nice O
welcome O
and O
, O
please O
feel O
at O
home O
. O

Here O
, O
in O
Mallorca O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
places O
to O
visit O
but B-INCORRECT
I O
will O
recommend O
you O
unique O
place O
without O
tourists O
noise O
and O
crowded O
beaches O
. O

On O
the O
east O
of O
Mallorca O
you O
will O
find O
a O
small O
and O
beautiful O
village O
called O
Artà O
. O

In O
the O

Artà O
you O
will O
find O
a O
coaster B-INCORRECT
town O
, O

Sa O
Colònia O

village O
. O

Nowadays O
, O

some O
fishermen O
fishing O
on O
the O
seashore O
. O

Here O
your O
adventure O
starts O
. O

In O
order O
to O
get O
your O
destination O
you B-INCORRECT
must O
ride O
a O
bicycle O
and O
just O
enjoy O
the O
splendid O
panoramic O
view O
. O

You O
will O
ride O
until B-INCORRECT
Ca O
los O
cans O
, O
one O
of O
the O
most O
enigmatical B-INCORRECT
beaches O
Mallorca O
. O

This O
zone O
is O
part O
of O
a O
protected O
area O
, O
natural O
park O
. O

For O
that O
reason O
, O
you O
must O
go B-INCORRECT
riding B-INCORRECT
a B-INCORRECT
bike B-INCORRECT
or B-INCORRECT
walking B-INCORRECT
. O

As O
Machado O
said O
" O
se O
hace O
camino O
al O
andar O
. O

It O
means O
that O
the O
most O
important O
is O
way O
, O
journey O
. O

Going B-INCORRECT
on B-INCORRECT
a B-INCORRECT
bike B-INCORRECT
near O
the O
seashore O
with O
breeze O
of O
sea O
is O
one O
most O
relaxing O
experiences O
in O
life O
. O

On O
the O
way O
to O
Ca O
los O
cans O
, O
you O
will O
see O
typical O
Mediterranean O
vegetation O
. O

There O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
trees O
called O
" O
tamarells O
, O
native O
the O
coast O
Mallorca O
. O

Moreover O
, O
you O
will O
go B-INCORRECT
between O
two O
ancient O
obelisks O
which O
have O
been O
recently O
restored O
. O

Finally O
, O
you O
will O
get O
to O
Ca O
los O
Cans O
. O

It O
is O
a O
special O
beach O
with O
stones O
instead O
of O
sand O
and O
surrounded O
by O
trees O
hotels O
. O

There O
you O
can O
practise O
different O
sports O
. O

It O
is O
a O
perfect O
place O
to O
go O
diving O
because O
you O
can O
see O
different O
fishes O
, O
sea O
urchins O
and O
seaweed O
. O

There O
you O
can O
also O
take O
a O
canoe O
and O
paddle O
in O
the O
quite B-INCORRECT
sea O
. O

A B-INCORRECT
part B-INCORRECT
from O
sports O
, O
you O
should O
note O
two O
different O
culture O
points O
. O

On O
the O
one O
hand O
, O
there O
is O
what O
remains O
standing O
of O
edificatications B-INCORRECT
that O
were O
used O
to O
keep O
small O
boats O
local O
fishermen O
save B-INCORRECT
from O
storms O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
there O
is O
a O
prehistorical B-INCORRECT
tower O
called O
" O
Talaiot O
. O

The O
function O
of O
the O
Talaiots O
is O
not O
clear O
yet O
. O

Maybe O
it O
was O
a O
defensive O
tower O
or O
an O
important O
building O
for O
high O
- O
class O
people O
. O

It O
is O
important O
to O
stay O
in B-INCORRECT
the O
beach O
until O
sun O
goes O
down O
. O

The O
sunset O
in O
that O
place O
is O
ideal O
and O
romantic O
( O
especially O
if O
you O
are O
with O
your O
partner O
) O
will O
see O
how O
the O
sun O
goes O
behind O
mountain O
range O
of O
Tramuntana O
. O

From O
that O
seashore O
you O
can O
see O
all O
the O
Alcúdia O
bay O
, O
part O
of O
mountain O
range O
Tramuntana O
and O
cape O
Formentor O
. O

Ca O
los O
Cans O
is O
a O
mixture O
of O
sea O
, O
nature O
and O
culture O
. O

I O
am O
sure O
that O
you O
will O
like O
it O
and O
, O
of O
course O
need O
to O
ask O
a O
favour O
: O
Please B-INCORRECT
keep O
the O
secret O

Introduction O
. O

The O
aim O
of O
this O
report O
is O
to O
outline O
the O
best O
and O
worst O
qualities O
your O
centre O
after O
one O
year O
running O
. O

This O
report O
analyses O
the O
two O
main O
facilities O
: O
gym O
and O
swimming O
pool O
. O

The O
gym O
. O

The O
machines O
are O
fantastic O
and O
the O
staff O
is O
very O
helpful O
with O
every O
customer O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
gym O
is O
too O
small O
. O

Every O
afternoon O
it O
is O
crowded O
so B-INCORRECT
very O
difficult O
to O
do O
exercise O
. O

The O
swimming O
pool O
. O

It O
is O
ideal O
for O
people O
who O
do O
not O
compete O
because O
of O
its O
length O
, O
about O
20 O
metres O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
it O
is O
not O
too O
deep O
so O
excellent O
for O
people O
who O
want O
to O
learn O
how O
swim O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
changing O
rooms O
are O
too O
far O
from O
this O
facility O
so O
it O
is O
easy O
to O
catch O
a O
cold O
when O
someone O
goes O
one O
place O
another O
. O

Conclusions O
. O

The O
facilities O
are O
quite O
modern O
and O
the O
staff O
excellent O
but O
gym O
could O
be O
bigger O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
you O
would B-INCORRECT
put B-INCORRECT
heaters O
to O
avoid O
colds B-INCORRECT
in O
the O
passage B-INCORRECT
way B-INCORRECT
from O
changing O
rooms O
swimming O
pool O
. O

The O
Future O
of O
Public O
Transport O

When O
we O
imagine O
future B-INCORRECT
, O
rarely O
overcrowded O
buses O
and O
rusty O
subway O
trains O
. O

As O
technologies O
develop O
and O
become O
cheaper O
more B-INCORRECT
people O
buy O
personal B-INCORRECT
cars O
. O

A O
car O
allows O
us O
to O
move O
faster O
and O
not O
depend O
on O
others O
. O

Travalling B-INCORRECT
by O
car O
is O
also O
much O
more O
convenient O
. O

Does O
this O
all O
mean O
that O
the O
years O
of O
public O
transportation O
come B-INCORRECT
to O
an O
end O
? O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
it O
is O
not O
true O
. O

Firstly O
, O
there O
will O
always O
be O
people O
who O
not O
able O
to O
afford O
buy O
a O
car O
. O

Students O
, O
children O
from O
large O
families O
old B-INCORRECT
people O
will O
continue O
to O
use O
public O
transportation O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

Secondly O
, O
cars O
can O
also O
turn O
into O
public O
transport O
. O

Science O
fiction O
often O
depicts O
future B-INCORRECT
as O
the B-INCORRECT
world O
where O
cars O
are O
used O
freely O
. O

Anyone O
can O
use O
the O
nearest O
car O
he O
or O
she O
sees O
. O

Thirdly O
, O
people O
do O
not O
have O
an O
inborn O
driving O
skill O
so O
even O
in O
the O
future O
children B-INCORRECT
and O
teenagers O
will O
need O
public O
transportation O
. O

This O
is O
also O
true O
for O
older O
people O
, O
who O
lose O
the O
ability O
to O
drive O
as O
they O
age O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
public O
transportation O
is O
not O
likely O
to O
disappear O
at O
least O
during O
the O
nearest B-INCORRECT
tens B-INCORRECT
of B-INCORRECT
years B-INCORRECT
. O

The O
chart O
above O
gives O
some O
information O
about O
the O
average O
monthly O
salaries O
of O
nurses O
and O
doctors O
in O
four O
different O
countries O
. O

According O
to O
the O
chart O
, O
two O
countries O
with O
lowest O
salaries O
are O
Country O
A O
and O
B. O

These O
ones O
are O
called O
" O
source O
countries O
, O
which O
means O
that O
they O
provide O
a O
supply O
of O
health O
care O
workers O
to O
other O
. O

Otherwise O
, O
the O
countries O
with O
highest O
saliaries O
are O
country O
C O
and O
D. O
Differently O
from O
first O
two O
these O
ones O
called O
" O
destination O
because O
health O
care O
service O
is O
provided O
by O
foreign O
qualified O
workers O
. O

Moreover O
, O
in O
the O
first O
three O
countries O
doctors B-INCORRECT
earn O
about O
twice O
as O
much O
a O
nurse O
earns O
apart O
from O
last O
country O
Country O
D. O
In O
this O
one O
salary O
gap O
between O
and O
nurses O
is O
bigger O
than O
other O
. O

In O
Country O
D O
, O
the O
salaries O
of O
doctors O
are O
about O
three O
times O
higher O
than O
those O
nurses O
. O

In O
conlcusion B-INCORRECT
we O
can O
say O
that O
from B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
standpoint O
of O
doctors O
and O
nurses O
, O
working O
abroad O
is O
a O
much O
better O
deal O
. O

Boxing O
is O
a O
common O
, O
well O
known B-INCORRECT
and O
loved B-INCORRECT
sport O
amongst B-INCORRECT
most O
countries O
in O
the O
world O
however B-INCORRECT
it O
also O
punishing O
dangerous O
disliked O
to O
extent O
that O
many O
people O
want O
banned O
possibly O
with O
good O
reason O
. O

Boxing O
is O
a O
dangerous O
sport O
, B-INCORRECT
there B-INCORRECT
are O
relatively O
common O
deaths O
tragic O
injuries O
and O
even O
disease O
. O

All O
professional O
boxers O
are O
at O
risk O
from O
being O
killed O
in O
his B-INCORRECT
next O
fight O
. O

If O
not O
killed O
then B-INCORRECT
more O
likely O
paralysed O
. O

There O
have O
been O
a O
number O
of O
cases O
in O
the O
last O
ten O
years O
top O
few O
boxers O
having O
tragic O
losses O
throughout B-INCORRECT
their O
ranks O
. O

This O
is O
just O
from O
the O
elite O
few O
, O
and O
there O
s B-INCORRECT
more O
those O
below O
them O
. O

More O
deaths O
would O
occur O
through O
boxing O
if O
it O
were O
banned O
. O

The O
sport O
would O
go O
underground O
, O
there B-INCORRECT
be O
no O
safety O
measures O
like O
gloves O
a O
doctor O
paramedics O
or O
early O
stopping O
of O
the O
fight O
if O
someone O
looked O
unable O
to O
continue O
. O

With O
this O
going O
on O
the B-INCORRECT
people O
taking O
part O
will O
be O
dangerous O
, O
and O
streets O
. O

Dangerous O
dogs O
who O
were O
trained O
to O
kill O
and O
maim O
in O
similar O
underound B-INCORRECT
dog O
fights O
have O
already O
proved O
deadly O
innocent O
people O
, B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
new O
boxers O
could O
be O
even O
more O
at O
risk O
. O

Once O
boxing O
is O
banned O
and O
no O
- O
one O
grows O
up O
knowing O
it O
as O
acceptable O
there B-INCORRECT
will O
be O

in O
hopefully B-INCORRECT
less B-INCORRECT
all O
round O
violence O
making B-INCORRECT
towns O
cities O
much O
safer O
places O
to O
live O
, B-INCORRECT
fighting O
outside O
pubs O

violent O
attacks O
with B-INCORRECT
little O
or O
reason O
. O

change B-INCORRECT
the O
rules O
of O
boxing O
slightly O
would O
much O
improve O
safety O
risks O
sport O
and O
not O
detract O
form B-INCORRECT
entertainment O
. O

There O
are O
all O
sorts O
of O
proposals O
, B-INCORRECT
lighter O
and O
more O
cushioning O
gloves O
could O
be O
worn O
ban O
punches O
to O
the O
head O
headguards O
or B-INCORRECT
make O
fights O
shorter O
as O
most O
serious O
injuries O
occur O
in O
latter B-INCORRECT
rounds O
these B-INCORRECT
would O
show O
off O

Even O
if O

Many O

even O

risks O
that O

. O

In O
many O
of O
the O
minority O
works O
modern O
literature O
, O
there O
can O
be O
some O
emphasis O
on O
rebellion O
against O
oppressive O
forces O
. O

Although O
such O
a O
show O
of O
strength O
by O
these O
works O
' O
characters O
is O
sometimes O
viewed O
as O
violent O
and O
therefore O
negative O
contribution O
to O
the O
otherwise O
insightful O
thought O
author O
, O
it O
this O
conflict O
upon O
which O
many O
stories O
ethnic O
American O
literature O
are O
based O
. O

However O
, O
such O
a O
rebellion O
can O
not O
be O
seen O
clearly O
in O
each O
minority O
work O
and O
therefore O
the O
products O
of O
ethnic O
American O
literature O
catagorized B-INCORRECT
as O
merely O
result O
years O
oppression O
. O

Rather O
, O
this O
ever O
- O
changing O
and O
challenging O
aspect O
of O
minority O
literature O
creates O
an O
especially O
important O
necessity O
that O
each O
work O
be O
considered O
individually O
as O
both O
a O
product O
years O
struggle O
inherently O
distinct O
from O
any O
other O
. O

In O
the O
minority O
works O
, O
conflict O
and O
rebellion O
presented O
accurately O
reflects O
society O
as O
a O
whole O
although O
mother O
's B-INCORRECT

Rebellion O
is O
seen O
not O
as O
a O
distinct O
force O
in O
minority O
cultures O
, O
but O
rather O
binding O
between O
all O
for O
Celie O
too O
resists O
her O

The O
Color O
Purple O
and O
the O
murderous O
loves O
Jazz O
reflect O
Tita O
Pedro O
's O
destructive O
passion O
Like O
Water O
Chocolate O
. O

Rebellion O
and O
conflict O
are O
emphasized O
in O
ethnic O
American O
literature O
, O
but O
they O
portrayed O
no O
more O
strongly O
minority O
works O
than O
other O
pieces O
of O
. O

Emphasis O
changes O
with O
each O
work O
, O
and O
although O
figures O
of O
authority O
are O
particullary B-INCORRECT
oppressive O
in O
works O
such O
as O
Like O
Water O
for O
Chocolate O
The O
Color O
Purple O
other O
minority O
including O
Love O
Medicine O
Jazz O
do O
not O
reflect O
the O
clearly O
defined O
authoritarian O
nor O
obvious O
rebellion O
characters O
' O
responsive O
action O
which O
previously O
mentioned O
show O
. O

This O
again O
implies O
that O
these O
etnic B-INCORRECT
American O
pieces O
of O
literature O
can O
not O
be O
catagorized B-INCORRECT
as O
merely O
rebellious O
responses O
to O
oppression O
, O
but O
individual O
reflections O
personal O
and O
cultural O
experiences O
. O

How O
does O
Voltaire O
tackle O
the O
question O
of O
philosophical O
optimism O
in O
' O
Candide O
? O

Philosophical O
optimism O
-l'optimisme- O
is O
the O
philosophy O
that O
everything O
and O
occurence B-INCORRECT
for O
some O
good O
. O

Voltaire O
sets O
out O
in O
Candide O
to O
criticise O
this O
philosophy O
. O

In O
Candide O
the B-INCORRECT
representative O
of O
this O
philosophy O
is O
Pangloss O
, O
philosopher O
employed O
at O
Thunder O
- O
der O
Troncks O
. O

The O
whole O
book O
is O
a O
criticism O
of O
l'optimisme O
. O

For O
example O
when B-INCORRECT
Candide O
is O
forced O
to O
join O
the O
Bulgar O
army O
he O
beaten O
almost O
death O
but B-INCORRECT
does O
not O
concern O
himself O
because O
know O
it O
for O
his O
own O
good O
- O
in O
fact O
later B-INCORRECT
book O
uses O
training O
become O
a O
soldier O
. O

Although O
this O
would O
seem O
to O
be O
good O
it B-INCORRECT
is O
not O
because B-INCORRECT
of O
his O
training O
he B-INCORRECT
kills O
two O
men O
, O
a O
Jew O
and O
an O
Archbishop O
with O
no O
hesitation O
then O
proceeds O
kill O
sweethearts B-INCORRECT
brother O
. O

Voltaire O
show B-INCORRECT
his O
dislike O
of O
l'optimisme O
when O
Pangloss O
, B-INCORRECT
Candide O
and O
James O
are O
caught O
in O
a O
bad O
storm O
at O
sea O
which O
is O
drowned O
there O
only O
three O
survivors O
sailor O
. O

The O
storm O
was O
caused O
by O
an O
earthquake O
which O
destroys O
the O
city O
to B-INCORRECT
Candide O
sailing O
. O

On O
arrival O
they O
see O
starvation O
and O
death O
. O

Candide O
is O
obviously O
horrified O
, O
especially O
when O
the O
sailor O
begins O
pillaging O
city O
. O

Candide O
looks O
to O
Pangloss O
for O
an O
answer O
but B-INCORRECT
can O
only O
tell O
him O
that O
some O
good O
will O
come O
of O
it O
. O

Candide O
, O
although O
remaining O
true O
to O
the O
ideals O
of O
optimism O
always O
appears O
be O
sceptical O
it O
. O

This O
is O
no O
more O
true O
than O
when O
he O
arrives O
in O
the O
new O
world O
, O
South O
America O
and O
has O
to O
leave O
his O
darling O
Cunégonde O
with O
Commissioner O
of O
province O
. O

Candide O
can O
not O
see O
what O
possible O
good O
come O
of O
this O
especially B-INCORRECT
as O
the O
reason O
that O
he O
was O
in O
America O
due O
to O
him O
killing O
Jew O
and O
Archbishop O
because O
they O
were O
Cunégonde O
's O
lovers O
. O

Throughout O
the O
book O
we B-INCORRECT
begin O
to O
see O
how B-INCORRECT
Candide O
is O
gradually O
lead B-INCORRECT
away O
for B-INCORRECT
l'optimisme O
or O
perhaps B-INCORRECT
more O
importantly O
shown O
be O
philosophy O
of O
despair O
. O

The O
constant O
belief O
that O
good O
can O
come O
from O
bad O
is O
not O
actually O
inspiring O
but O
leads O
to O
a O
flow O
of O
disasters O
. O

Candide O
's O
life O
, O
in O
the O
book O
appears O
to O
show O
this O
. O

He O
is O
thrown O
out O
of O
Thunder O
- O
den O
Tronck O
because O
he O
embraces O
Cunégonde O
, O
duped O
into O
the O
army O
caught O
in O
an O
earthquake O
almost O
killed O
as O
part O
auto O
da O
fé O
kills O
three O
churchmen O
eaten O
finds O
Eldorado O
but O
leaves- B-INCORRECT
list O
continues O
. O

Candide O
's O
life O
is O
governed O
by O
his O
belief O
the B-INCORRECT
good O
will O
prevail O
. O

Eventually O
, O
of O
course O
he O
does O
marry O
Cunégonde O
but B-INCORRECT
she O
is O
not O
the O
beautiful O
young O
flower O
that O
once O
loved O
. O

She O
has O
become O
ugly O
and O
grew B-INCORRECT
worse O
by O
the O
day O
. O

This O
illustrates O
emphatically O
the O
folly O
of O
l'optimisme O
. O

Candide O
has O
travelled O
the O
world O
in B-INCORRECT
search O
of O
Cunégonde O
, O
with O
hope O
that O
he O
will O
marry O
her B-INCORRECT
despite B-INCORRECT
all O
trouble O
which O
gone O
through O
course O
end O
does O
get O
but O
at O
price O
looks O
and O
personality O
. O

Voltaire O
, O
in O
Candide O
shows O
how O
the O
philosophy O
of O
Optimism O
is O
one O
despair O
not B-INCORRECT
hope O
. O

It O
would O
be O
tempting O
to O
think O
of O
the O
various O
European O
Communities O
as O
an O
embryonic O
United O
States O
Europe O
; O
especially O
when O
we O
hear O
politicians O
talk O
importance O
Unity O
. O

However O
it B-INCORRECT
is O
important O
to O
realise O
that O
Europe O
a O
very O
long O
way O
from O
becoming O
anything O
like O
the O
United O
States O
. O

When O
the O
original O
13 O
American O
states O
resolved O
to O
form O
what O
is O
now O
United O
States O
of O
America O
, O
they O
were O
intent O
on O
forming O
a O
political O
as O
well O
economic O
entity O
. O

They O
were O
prepared O
to O
yield O
as O
much O
of O
their O
own O
sovereignty O
would O
be O
essential O
allow O
the O
newly O
formed B-INCORRECT
national O
government O
operate O
a O
single O
international O
political O
force O
. O

A O
balance O
was O
therefore O
struck O
in O
the O
constitution O
to O
allow O
individual O
states O
as O
much O
self O
- O
government O
possible O
while O
ensuring O
that O
, O
for O
example O
military O
matters O
central O
spoke O
all O
. O

It O
is O
true O
that O
today O
one O
still O
hears O
the O
old O
dispute O
over O
state O
sovereignty O
and O
attempts O
to O
return O
some O
power O
individual O
states O
, O
but O
no O
- O
would O
challenge O
fact O
on O
matters O
external O
United O
States O
government O
in O
Washington O
represents O
sole O
policy O
making O
body O
. O

In O
Europe O
it O
is O
quite O
clear O
that O
many O
people O
would O
like O
to O
see O
a O
political O
union O
of O
the O
countries O
since B-INCORRECT
this O
produce O
formidable O
international O
military O
force O
. O

However O
it B-INCORRECT
is O
equally O
clear O
that O
while O
there O
might O
be O
some O
unified O
political O
action O
flowing O
from O
the O
European O
Communities O
( O
such O
as O
was O
seen O
over O
Europe O
's O
response O
to O
British O
involvement O
in O
Falkland O
Islands O
dispute O
) O
, O
were O
intended O
purely O
economic O
entities O
first O
place O
. O

Membership O
almost O
certainly O
involves O
some O
loss O
of O
national O
sovereignty O
, O
but O
the O
United O
Kingdom O
could O
probably O
leave O
community O
by O
a O
simple O
majority O
vote O
in O
Westminster O
Parliament O
something O
which O
no O
state O
States O
lawfully O
do O
. O

We O
are O
still O
a O
very O
long O
way O
from O
Single O
Parliament O
for O
Western O
Europe O
with O
power O
to O
make O
political O
decisions O
all O
; B-INCORRECT
and O
even O
1992 O
approaching O
single O
market O
the B-INCORRECT
gulf O
between O
UK O
is O
wide O
. O

The O
supremacy O
of O
Parliament O
will O
never O
be O
challanged B-INCORRECT
. O

Its O
ability O
to O
make O
and O
break O
any O
law O
- O
made O
by O
it O
or O
Europe O
means O
that O
retains O
full O
sovereignty O
. O

Even O
if O
today O
it O
made O
laws O
to B-INCORRECT
that O
would O
unite O
fully O
with O
Europe O
and O
relinquish O
its O
sovereignty O
for O
ever O
, O
could O
tomorrow O
repeal O
all O
those O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
Parliament O
does O
not O
bind O
itself O
or O
can O
be O
bound O
by O
any O
political O
body O
means O
it O
never O
lose O
its O
sovereignty O
unless O
a O
majority O
of O
the O
population O
wished O
and O
consented O
. O

But O
with O
the O
average O
jingoistic O
Briton O
there O
is O
no O
chance O
of O
us O
curing O
ourselves O
our O
xenophobia O
and O
ever O
wishing O
to O
be O
fully O
intergrated B-INCORRECT
Europe O
. O

Even O
now O
the O
channel O
tunnel O
has O
joined O
us O
to O
continent O
we O
still O
consider O
ourselves O
be O
separated O
from O
world O
standing B-INCORRECT
alone O
against O
a O
hostile O
. O

Naturally O
, O
the O
problems O
of O
a O
single O
Europe O
would O
run O
as O
deeply O
benefits O
that O
we O
presumably O
ultimately O
receive O
. O

It O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
for B-INCORRECT
the O
past O
few O
centuries O
, O
Britain O
has O
always O
considered O
itself O
be O
detached O
from O
rest O
of O
Europe O
. O

Whenever O
necessary O
, O
she O
has O
allied O
herself O
to O
European O
powers O
such O
as O
in O
times O
of B-INCORRECT
war O
extreme O
distrust O
. O

Britain O
has O
been O
eager O
to O
maintain O
a O
secure O
balance O
of O
power O
on O
the O
continent O
, O
but O
throughout O
history O
she O
more O
concerned O
with O
her O
oversees O
empires O
than O
anywhere O
else O
. O

In O
the O
latter B-INCORRECT
half O
century B-INCORRECT
though B-INCORRECT
, O
her O
empire O
has O
diminished O
and O
she O
had O
to O
face O
mounting O
responsibility O
in O
Europe O
. O

Because O
of O
her O
history O
isolated O
sovereignty O
it B-INCORRECT
is O
difficult O
to O
accept O
being O
a O
part O
single O
Europe O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
British O
law O
is O
based O
largely O
upon O
precedent O
that O
judge B-INCORRECT
made O
. O

We O
have O
established O
a O
system O
of O
law O
which O
dates O
back O
many O
centuries O
, O
and O
is O
widely O
known O
respected O
. O

There O
is O
very O
little O
European O
influence O
on O
our O
law O
, O
of O
course O
in B-INCORRECT
many O
respects O
it O
will O
be O
the O
same O
but O
lack O
display O
differences O
. O

With O
the O
creation O
of O
a O
single O
Europe O
, O
new O
law O
will O
have O
to O
be O
accepted O
throughout O
continent O
and O
it O
cause O
both O
confusion O
conflict O
. O

The O
British O
tend O
to O
be O
very O
proud O
and O
possessive O
of O
the O
law O
, O
changes O
may O
well O
cause O
illfeeling B-INCORRECT
discontent O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
the O
same O
points O
will O
apply O
to O
monetary O
system O
in O
Europe O
. O

Will O
there O
just O
be O
one O
system O
? O

The O
country O
typically O
is O
against O
major O
change O
and O
something O
as O
fundamental O
money O
would O
cause O
problems O
if O
it O
was O
to O
be O
altered O
. O

Our O
individual O
monetary O
system O
I B-INCORRECT
suppose O
, O
could O
be O
seen O
as O
a O
symbol O
of O
sovereignty O
. O

It O
can O
be O
said O
that O
if O
a O
single O
Europe O
was O
created O
, O
problems O
may O
arise O
over O
its O
fundamental O
political O
concepts O
. O

Of O
course O
Britain O
would O
lose O
her O
sovereignty O
, O
as O
the O
other O
nations O
of O
union O
. O

It O
has O
been O
suggested O
that O
the O
Single O
Union O
could O
be O
based O
on O
a O
basic O
federal O
structure O
, O
whereby O
local O
autonomy O
saved O
but O
union O
as O
whole O
work O
together O
in O
democratic O
manner O
. O

To O
a O
certain O
extent O
, O
even O
if O
sovereignty O
was O
lost O
some O
national O
personality O
would O
be O
preserved O
. O

The O
fact O
is O
that O
, O
when O
united O
European O
unity O
would O
still O
in B-INCORRECT
essence O
be B-INCORRECT
divided O
. O

There O
will O
always O
be O
aspects O
of O
one O
society O
that O
the O
others O
never O
accept O
. O

Europe O
as O
a O
whole O
faces O
the O
same O
problems O
, O
and O
therefore O
if O
single O
was O
created O
uniting O
Britain O
could O
be O
dealt O
with O
quickly O
efficiently O
. O

If O
the O
Federalists O
achieved O
their O
aims O
in O
a O
European O
unity O
, O
they O
would O
do O
best O
to O
achieve O
democracy O
and O
promote O
it O
nationally O
so O
that O
individuality O
is O
preserved O
all O
of O
positive O
features O
will O
be O
known O
. O

The O
problem O
facing O
the O
British O
, O
really O
results O
from O
their O
isolated O
past O
. O

The O
sovereignty O
of O
the O
nation O
has O
deep O
roots O
, O
and O
fears O
losing O
it O
are O
very B-INCORRECT
great O
. O

Whether O
this O
would O
happen O
awaits O
to O
be O
seen O
, O
and O
depend O
completely O
on O
the O
terms O
of O
union O
negotiations O
feelings O
general O
public O
politicians O
leading O
countries O
. O

With O
1992 O
now O
only O
a O
year O
away O
, O
the O
question O
of O
what O
Single O
Europe O
will O
mean O
for O
Britain O
becomes O
increasingly O
relevant O
. O

I O
firmly O
believe O
that O
the O
advent O
of O
1992 O
will O
result O
in O
a O
loss O
sovereignty O
for O
Britain O
. O

This O
loss O
need O
not O
however O
be O
negative O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
in O
political O
economic O
and O
defence O
terms O
I B-INCORRECT
feel O
this O
realocation B-INCORRECT
of O
resources O
can O
will O
be O
very O
positive O
. O

Whilst O
to B-INCORRECT
a O
certain O
extent O
I B-INCORRECT
may O
be O
guilty O
of O
having O
an O
island O
mentality O
, O
would O
n't O
go O
as O
far O
say O
Britain O
is O
in O
danger O
handing O
all O
control O
over O
faceless O
beaurocrats B-INCORRECT
Brussels O
or O
Strasbourg O
. O

Throughout O
the O
world O
a B-INCORRECT
wind O
of O
change O
is O
apparent O
, O
but O
especially O
so O
in O
Europe O
. O

This O
process O
will O
continue O
and O
Europe O
the B-INCORRECT
rest O
of O
world O
evolue B-INCORRECT
with O
or O
without O
participation O
Britain O
in O
this O
. O

It O
is O
my O
belief O
that O
Britain O
must O
be O
involved O
in O
the O
decision O
making B-INCORRECT
which O
will O
eventually O
decide O
new O
world O
order O
. O

However O
to B-INCORRECT
be O
fully O
involved O
, O
sacrifices O
have O
made O
. O

Such O
sacrifices O
will O
involve O
certain O
aspects O
of O
our O
sovereignty O
. O

In O
relenquishing B-INCORRECT
and O
thus O
centralising O
certain O
powers O
, O
the O
aim O
is O
not O
to O
diminish O
strength O
of O
individual O
nations O
but O
increase O
overall O
impact O
Europe O
on O
world O
stage O
. O

As O
amply O
demonstrated O
by O
recent O
events O
in O
the O
Gulf O
, O
European O
cooperation O
field O
of O
defence O
can O
be O
both O
impressive O
and O
effective O
. B-INCORRECT
Whilst O
I O
would O
reluctant O
to B-INCORRECT
hand O
over O
all O
control O
any O
central O
body O

I O
can O
see O
a O
future O
for O
some O
form O
of O
European O
rapid O
reaction O
force O
. O

Whilst O
to B-INCORRECT
an O
extent O
crippling B-INCORRECT
defence O
costs O
could O
be O
cut O
this B-INCORRECT
would O
not O
necessarily O
lead O
a O
reduction O
in O
the O
size O
of O
available O
. O

In O
political O
terms O
, O
regardless O
of O
legislation O
Britain O
like B-INCORRECT
the O
rest O
Europe O
is B-INCORRECT
becoming O
increasingly O
cosmopolitan O
in O
population O
composition B-INCORRECT
. O

The O
North O
Sea O
will O
increasingly O
come O
to O
represent O
a O
mere O
puddle O
as O
people O
move O
between O
countries O
. O

I O
feel O
it O
is O
important O
for O
Britain O
to O
join O
fully O
with O
its O
European O
partners O
adapt O
these O
changes O
in O
demography O
. O

Politically O
we B-INCORRECT
are O
moving O
closer O
together O
. O

Possible O
problems O
should O
be O
studied O
and O
solved O
if O
possible O
before O
they O
happen O
. O

E.R.M. O
is O
already O
upon O
us O
but B-INCORRECT
in O
this O
area O
I O
feel O
Britain O
should O
be O
especially O
careful O
. O

Whilst O
not O
pretending O
to O
fully O
understand O
this O
system O
I B-INCORRECT
do O
know O
that O
no O
can O
lower O
interest O
rates O
, O
and O
inflation O
while O
raising O
growth O
with O
the O
possible O
exception O
of O
Magic O
Circle O
. O

In O
the O
area O
of O
single O
currency O
, O
again O
I O
feel O
this O
is O
inevitable O
. O

What O
is O
important O
to O
base O
this O
currency O
on O
the O
strong O
currencies O
within O
EEC O
as O
opposed O
an O
average O
based B-INCORRECT
system O
. O

To O
conclude O
I B-INCORRECT
would O
say O
a O
single O
Europe O
is O
already O
happening O
and O
that O
it O
will O
continue O
to O
do O
so O
guaranteed O
. O

Britain O
must O
not O
concern O
itself O
with O
loss O
of O
sovereignty O
but O
gain O
the O
European O
equivalent O
. O

If O
we O
miss O
the O
boat O
I O
think O
will O
drawn B-INCORRECT
before O
next O
comes O
. O

When O
the O
treaty O
of O
Rome O
was O
signed O
in O
1957 O
, O
foundation O
laid O
for O
a O
new O
" O
continent O
- O
united O
Europe O
. O

It O
was O
said O
that O
Europe O
would O
not O
be O
created O
quickly O
, O
but O
over O
several O
years O
. O

When O
Britain O
entered O
the O
European O
Community O
in O
1973 O
after B-INCORRECT
a O
national O
referendum O
, O
debate O
began O
concerning O
Britains B-INCORRECT
relationship O
with O
Europe O
. O

When O
1992 O
was O
set O
as O
the O
date O
for O
single B-INCORRECT
European O
Market O
, O
debate O
flared O
up O
again O
but O
over O
how O
far O
Britain O
should O
be O
integrated O
. O

The O
rest O
of O
Europe O
seems O
prepared O
for O
1992 O
but B-INCORRECT
Britain O
to O
be O
decidedly O
hesitant O
. O

The O
former O
Prime O
Minister O
, O
Margaret O
Thatcher O
was O
not O
been O
to O
lead O
Britain O
into O
a O
United O
Europe O
because O
she O
felt O
it O
would O
loss O
of O
our O
sovereignty O
. O

There O
is O
no O
doubt O
an O
integrated O
market O
would O
have O
multiple O
benefits O
for O
the O
countries O
involved O
. O

Businesses O
and O
other O
trading O
organizations O
are O
preparing O
themselves O
for O
1992 O
, O
the O
single O
market O
. O

Trade O
will O
be O
easier O
, O
with O
no O
frontier O
controls O
allowing B-INCORRECT
free O
flowing O
transportation O
of O
merchandise O
. O

There O
will O
be O
business O
booms O
and O
free O
competition O
with O
the O
removal O
of O
protective O
practices O
, O
along O
greater O
freedom O
to O
travel O
. O

Many O
Britons O
would O
consider O
Europe O
has O
affected O
Britain O
too O
much O
already O
, O
with O
decimalization O
the O
new O

They O
may O
feel O

is O
being O
pulled O
into O
Europe O

Further O
changes O
are O
forecast O
for O
Britain O
, O
effecting B-INCORRECT
day O

create O
a O
" O
European O

This O
may O
make O
Britons O
resentful O
of O
Europe O
and O
tired O
" O
1992 O
all O
that O
. O

A O
single O
market O
requires O
one O
central O
institution O
to O
co O
- O
ordinate O
all O
movements O
of O
goods O
and O
policies O

Will O
the O
people O
of O
Britain O
be O
prepared O
to O
give O
up O
their O
government O
and O
directed O
from O
Strasbourg O
or O

? O
. B-INCORRECT

Many O
people O
would O
not O
. O

Will O
the O
day O
come O
when O
pound O
sterling O
is O
taken O
over O
by O

? O

It O
may O
well O
- O
but O
will O
the B-INCORRECT
Britons O
have O
a O
chance O
to O
voice O
their O
opinions O
and O
views O
? O

Europe O
may O
argue O
that O
the O
benefits O
from O
a O
single O
integrated O
market O
would O
far O
outweigh O
any O
national O
drawbacks O
. O

As O
the O
date O
draws O
nearer O
, O
awareness O
of O
Britons O
to B-INCORRECT
Europe O
must O
increase O
. O

They O
must O
look O
into O
the O
future O
and O
consider O
possible O
effects O
. O

Will O
Britain O
be O
drawn O
into O
Europe O
against O
its O
will O
? O

Perhaps O
as O
more O
of O
Britain O
becomes O
" O
Eurofied O
, O
Britons O
will O
wake O
up O
and O
see O
their O
sovereignty O
is O
being O
taken O
away O
. O

Britain O
has O
never O
geographically O
been O
a O
part O
of O
Europe O
. O

We O
are O
in O
the O
EEC O
and O
we O
should O
be O
able O
to O
benefit O
from O
free O
trade O
. O

We O
have O
been O
an O
island O
for O
too O
long O
- O
being O
independent O
and O
able O
to O
stand O
alone O
. O

We O
have O
a O
sound O
democratic O
process O
, O
which O
many O
people O
would O
not O
want O
to O
give O
this O
up O
. O

A O
fully O
integrated O
market O
with O
Britain O
as O
a O
full O
member O
would O
be O
to O
the O
detriment O
of O
our O
political O
system O
and O
consequently O
leading B-INCORRECT
loss O
sovereignty O
. O

There O
has O
been O
such O
a O
lot O
of O
talk O
about O
Single O
Europe O
in O
recent O
years O
that O
it O
is O
hard O
to O
believe O
will O
be O
upon O
us O
very O
soon O
. O

Now O
that O
it O
is O
a O
reality O
, O
and O
not O
just O
probability O
the O
question O
in O
minds O
of O
many O
Britons O
indeed B-INCORRECT
: O
Will O
this O
mean O
loss O
sovereignty O
for O
Britain O
or O
birth O
nation O
? O

Firstly O
, O
a O
positive O
approach O
. O

Looking O
at O
things O
from O
an O
economic O
perspective O
, O
this O
is O
not O
a O
problem O
. O

The O
benefits O
in O
terms O
of O
cost O
- O
cutting O
owing O
to O
doing O
things O
once O
, O
instead O
twelve O
times O
will O
be O
enormous O
. O

Firms O
, O
because O
of O
being O
able O
to O
pool O
their O
resources O
will O
be O
devote O
more O
time O
research O
and O
development O
thus O
products O
improve O
. O

Europe O
will O
therefore O
be O
a O
nation O
to O
reckoned O
with O
as O
regards O
competition O
. O

To O
look O
at O
things O
on O
a O
more O
individual O
level O
, O
every O
member O
of O
the O
new O
Single O
Europe O
's O
standard O
living O
should O
increase O
. O

A O
greater O
potential O
of O
ideas O
from O
a O
number O
experts O
will O
, O
in O
theory O
result O
more O
knowledgeable O
and O
better O
- O
informed O
individuals O
. O

Simplicity O
is O
one O
of O
the O
Commission O
's O
key O
aims O
, O
with O
idea O
that O
if O
things O
are O
simpler O
and O
more O
easy O
for O
everyone O
to O
understand O
people B-INCORRECT
will O
be O
happier O
get O
on O
better O
. O

If O
this O
is O
so O
, O
they O
should O
also O
work O
better O
. O

Ideally O
then O
, O
there O
should O
be O
more O
equality O
less O
crime O
greater O
productivity O
and O
economic O
growth O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
will O
this O
Single O
Europe O
mean O
a O
loss O
of O
sovereignty O
for O
Britain O
? O

It O
must O
be O
remembered O
that O
not O
only O
does O
Britain O
have O
a O
small O
population O
compared O
to O
the O
majority O
of O
other O
member O
states O
, O
but O
it O
is O
an O
island O
- O
which O
none O
others O
are O
. O

Why O
should O
this O
matter O
? O

Well O
, O
Britain O
has O
quite O
a O
history O
and O
therefore O
fair O
number O
of O
traditions O
. O

It O
is O
possible O
that O
it O
could O
become O
engulfed O
in O
the O
new O
Single O
Europe O
and O
lose O
its O
identity O
. O

Britons O
( O
especially O
those O
from O
older O
generations O
) O
may O
then O
feel O
" O
lost O
and O
that O
they O
do O
not O
really O
belong O
any O
more O
. O

The O
new O
Single O
Europe O
may O
be O
too O
and O
unknown O
for O
them O
to O
make O
their O
allegiance O
it O
. O

Then O
there O
is O
the O
question O
as O
to O
whether O
all O
this O
idealism O
really O
will O
work O
. O

Will O
there O
be O
greater O
prosperity O
, O
better O
- O
informed O
happier O
citizens O
or O
will O
this O
never O
come O
off O
because O
of O
politicians O
being O
unable O
to O
agree O
on O
policies O
? O

Britain O
, O
although O
small O
is O
more O
often O
than O
not O
in B-INCORRECT
the O
fore O
of O
international O
matters O
taking O
a O
definite O
stance O
on O
what O
it O
considers O
to O
be O
right O
. O

Has O
it O
then O
not O
got O
quite O
a O
lot O
at O
stake O
, O
its O
character O
least O
in O
integrating O
itself O
into O
this O
Single O
Europe O
? O

No O
one O
would O
dispute O
that O
this O
is O
a O
difficult O
question O
. O

The O
fact O
remains O
however O
that O
next O
year O
( O
in O
1992 O
) O
there O
is O
going O
to O
be O
a O
Single O
Europe O
. O

This O
, O
as O
everyone O
is O
well O
aware O
not O
going O
to O
be O
achieved O
with O
ease O
but O
the O
more O
tolerant O
every O
member O
state O
of O
each O
other O
successful O
Single O
Europe O
will O
. O

It O
is O
up O
to O
Britain O
therefore O
accept O
this O
fact O
and O
show O
an O
example O
by O
leading O
the O
way O
as O
regards O
tolerancy B-INCORRECT
. O

Then O
we O
will O
all O
be O
able O
to O
look O
at O
the O
future O
in O
a O
more O
positive O
way O
. O

The O
European O
Community O
is O
a O
unique O
grouping O
of O
twelve O
sovereign O
Member O
States O
who O
are O
committed O
to O
the O
development O
closer O
economic O
and O
political O
co O
- O
operation O
. O

The O
community O
has O
an O
aim O
to O
break O
down O
the O
economic O
and O
political O
barriers O
that O
have O
traditionally O
divided O
Europe O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
the O
community O
seeks O
to O
facilitate O
greater O
movement O
within O
its O
frontiers O
; O
not O
only O
of O
goods O
but O
services O
capital O
and O
people O
. O

However O
, O
the O
issue O
of O
sovereignty O
is O
certainly O
a O
much O
debated O
one O
; B-INCORRECT
to O
what O
extent O
should O
member O
hand O
over O
its O
Community O
if O
at O
all O
? O

Let O
us O
look O
at O
the O
founding O
of O
European O
Community O
, O
before O
we O
discuss O
issue O
sovereignty O
in O
more O
detail O
. O

There O
were O
several O
attempts O
at O
peaceful O
unification O
after O
the O
First O
World O
War O
, O
but O
only O
Europe O
had O
again O
been O
devastated O
by O
war O
was O
futility O
of O
national O
rivalry O
truly O
apparent O
. O

The O
political O
and O
economic O
exhaustion O
of O
the O
European O
states O
called O
for O
a O
fresh O
start O
far O
more O
radical O
approach O
to O
re O
- O
ordering O
Europe O
. O

This O
fresh O
start O
came O
about O
because O
of O
three O
main O
factors O
. O

Firstly B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
was O
Europe O
's O
realization O
of O
her O
own O
weakness O
after O
having O
lost O
age O
- O
old O
position O
at O
the O
centre O
world O
stage O
to O
United O
States O
America O
and O
Soviet O
Union O
. O

These O
superpowers O
were O
economically O
, O
militarally B-INCORRECT
and O
politically O
stronger O
than O
the O
divided O
individual O
European O
states O
. O

Secondly B-INCORRECT
was O
the B-INCORRECT
conviction O
that O
military O
conflict O
should O
in O
future O
be O
avoided O
; O
after O
all O
, O
two O
great O
wars O
had O
both O
begun O
as O
European O
" O
civil O
. O
Thirdly B-INCORRECT
common O
desire O
for O
a O
better O
freer O
world O
which O
international O
relations O
would O
conducted O
more O
orderly O
way O

One O
of O
the O
first O
major O
moves O
towards O
European O
integration O
was O
creation O
Economic O
Community O
, O
in O
1958 O
. O

Its O
membership O
has O
grown O
from O
the O
ten O
original O
founder O
countries O
to O
twenty O
- O
three O
. O

One O
of O
the O
most O
innovative O
features O
European O
Community O
compared O
with O
other O
international O
bodies O
is O
that O
member O
states O
have O
ceded O
to O
it O
a O
part O
their O
national O
sovereignty O
and O
endowed O
its O
own O
sovereign O
powers O
, O
which O
can O
use O
adopt O
acts O
having O
force O
law O
. O

This O
novel O
approach O
to O
pooling O
national O
sovereignty O
is O
called O
" O
integration O
. O

The O
1970 B-INCORRECT
's B-INCORRECT
saw O
progress O
in O
integration O
, O
with O
the O
introduction O
of O
community O
policy O
instruments O
which O
enabled O
greater O
scope O
for O
national O
policies O
. O

All O
of O
the O
member O
states O
agree O
in O
principle O
to O
idea O
a O
single O
market O
by O
1992 O
, O
however O
each O
wish O
their O
own O
interests O
be O
safeguarded O
. O

This O
is O
to O
say O
that O
none O
want O
sacrifice O
their O
national O
sovereignty O
, O
many O
unanimous O
voting O
not O
majority O
. O

Many O
see O
this O
issue O
as O
a O
threat O
to O
their O
own O
regulations O
and O
laws O
, O
could O
foresee B-INCORRECT
drop O
in O
standards O
if O
they O
do O
not O
stand O
firm O
. O

The O
situation O
is O
seen O
as O
a O
threat O
to O
the O
countries O
in O
question O
who B-INCORRECT
do O
not O
wish O
boldly O
give O
up O
their O
sovereignty O
for O
sake O
of O
European O
unity O
. O

Whether O
or O
not O
the O
continuation O
of O
progress O
in O
field O
European O
unity O
is O
sucessful B-INCORRECT
depends O
very O
much O
on O
people O
Europe O
. O

If O
a O
feeling O
of O
European O
unity O
develops O
and O
can O
be O
sustained O
, O
the O
threat O
will O
subside O
as O
identity O
takes O
over O
. O

On O
Britains B-INCORRECT
roads O
there O
is O
an O
ever O
increasing B-INCORRECT
volume O
of O
traffic O
. O

The O
road O
network O
is O
no O
longer O
able O
to O
carry O
this O
traffic O
without O
hold O
- O
ups O
and O
jams O
.. B-INCORRECT

To O
remedy O
this O
the B-INCORRECT
government O
has O
started O
adding O
a O
fourth O
lane O
on O
some O
streches B-INCORRECT
of O
our O
motorways O
and O
constructing O
ring O
roads O
bypasses O
, O
with O
mixed O
reception O
. O

While O
the O
road O
system O
is O
being O
improoved B-INCORRECT
there O
seems O
to O
be O
an O
endless O
series O
of O
roadworks O
which O
restrict O
highways O
and O
cause O
further O
delay B-INCORRECT
while O
are O
in O
place O
. O

The O
inability O
to O
cope O
with O
the O
ammount B-INCORRECT
of O
traffic O
by B-INCORRECT
road O
system O
obviously O
increases O
risk O
drives B-INCORRECT
having O
an O
accident O
and O
drivers O
have O
be O
constantly O
alert O
as O
they O
are O
nearly O
always O
in O
capacity O
. O

It O
might O
seem O
an O
easy O
soloution B-INCORRECT
to O
this O
mayhem O
would O
be O
use O
public O
transport O
; O
i.e. O
the O
Railways B-INCORRECT
. O

People O
are O
not O
taking O
to O
the O
Rail B-INCORRECT
system O
because O
of O
its O
lack O
integration O
due O
recent O
privitisation B-INCORRECT
different O
areas O
. O

It O
has O
been O
shown O
that O
different O
companies O
charge O
fares O
for O
exactly O
the O
same O
route O
! O

The O
main O
disadvantage O
with O
the O
railways O
is O
as B-INCORRECT
rail O
service O
and O
bus O
are O
normally O
owned O
by O
different O
companies O
it B-INCORRECT
probable O
that O
not O
possible O
to O
walk O
onto O
a O
off O
train O
. O

If O
the O
services O
were O
integrated O
there B-INCORRECT
would O
be O
a O
bus O
time B-INCORRECT
table B-INCORRECT
which O
coincided O
with O
train O
arrival O
times O
. O

Then O
people O
would O
be O
more O
likely O
to O
catch O
the O
train O
as B-INCORRECT
they O
not O
have O
look O
forwards O
a O
long O
walk O
, O
wait O
for O
bos B-INCORRECT
or O
an B-INCORRECT
expensive O
taxi O
ride O
. O

My O
soloution B-INCORRECT
to O
the O
problem O
would O
be O
improve O
rail O
system O
and O
its O
related O
bus O
services O
, B-INCORRECT
this B-INCORRECT
get O
people O
of B-INCORRECT
roads O
onto O
trains O
. O

To O
improove B-INCORRECT
the O
rail O
service O
trains B-INCORRECT
have O
got O
to O
be O
timed O
arrive O
and O
depart O
at O
key O
times O
i.e. B-INCORRECT
eight O
o'clock O
leave O
half O
past O
six O
. O

The O
train O
and O
bus O
companies O
have O
to O
liase B-INCORRECT
with O
each O
other O
the O
fares O
remain O
relatively O
cheap O
i.e. B-INCORRECT
same O
price O
or B-INCORRECT
less O
as B-INCORRECT
it O
would O
cost O
go O
by O
car O
. O

The O
basic O
dilema B-INCORRECT
facing O
the O
UK O
's O
rail O
and O
road O
transport O
system O
is O
general O
rise O
in O
population O
. O

This O
leads O
to O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
number O
of O
commuters O
and O
transport O
users O
every O
year O
, O
consequently O
putting O
pressure O
on O
UKs B-INCORRECT
transports B-INCORRECT
network O
. O

The O
biggest O
worry O
to B-INCORRECT
the O
system O
is O
rapid O
rise O
of O
car O
users O
outside O
major O
cities O
. O

Most O
large O
cities O
have O
managed O
to O
incourage B-INCORRECT
commuters O
use O
public O
transport O
thus B-INCORRECT
decreasing O
major O
conjestion B-INCORRECT
in O
Rush B-INCORRECT
hour O
periods O
. O

Public O
transport O
is O
the O
obvious O
solution O
to B-INCORRECT
increase O
in O
population B-INCORRECT
if B-INCORRECT
it O
made O
cheep B-INCORRECT
commuters O
, O
clean O
easy O
and O
efficient O
then B-INCORRECT
could O
take O
strain O
of B-INCORRECT
overloaded O
British O
roads O
. O

For O
commuters O
who O
regularly O
travel O
long O
distances O
rail B-INCORRECT
transport O
should O
be O
made O
more O
appealing O
, O
comfortable O
and O
cheaper O
. O

Motorways O
and O
other O
transport O
links O
are O
constantly O
being O
extended O
, B-INCORRECT
widened O
slowly O
turning O
the O
country O
into O
a O
concrete O
jungle O
yet B-INCORRECT
it O
is O
only O
trying O
to O
cope O
with O
increase O
in O
traffic O
we B-INCORRECT
our O
own O
enemy O
! O

Another O
major O
problem O
created O
by O
the O
mass O
of O
vehicle B-INCORRECT
transport O
is O
pollution O
emitted O
into O
atmosphere O
damaging B-INCORRECT
ozone O
layer O
, O
creating O
smog O
and O
forming O
acid O
rain O
. O
Tourturing B-INCORRECT
Earth O
we O
are O
living O
on O

In O
concluding B-INCORRECT
I O
wish O
to O
propose O
clean O
, O
efficient O
comfortable O
and O
cheap O
public O
transport O
for O
the O
near O
future O
. O

The O
modern O
traffic O
jam O
is O
now O
a O
familiar O
situation O
to O
nearly O
all O
of O
the O
western O
worlds B-INCORRECT
population O
. O

If O
every O
time O
we O
use O
our O
cars O
to O
travel O
any O
distance O
find O
ourselfs B-INCORRECT
in O
a O
10 O
mile O
tail O
- O
back O
why B-INCORRECT
do O
still O
insist O
that B-INCORRECT
such O
ameander B-INCORRECT
. O

To O
illistrate B-INCORRECT
my O
point O
, O
if O
every O
time O
you O
took O
a O
train O
it O
stops B-INCORRECT
for O
2 O
hours O
on O
the O
track O
everyone O
would O
stop O
taking O
. O

So O
why O
do O
we O
still O
insist O
on O
travelling O
the O
road O
. B-INCORRECT

The O
answer B-INCORRECT
most B-INCORRECT
likly B-INCORRECT
lies O
in O
2 O
areas O
, B-INCORRECT
firsty B-INCORRECT
the O
attitude O
of O
many O
westerners O
is O
that O
" B-INCORRECT
it O
their O
right O
to O
travel O
such O
a O
mannor B-INCORRECT
' B-INCORRECT
. O

This O
is B-INCORRECT
in O
my O
opinion O
, O
shows O
considerable O
ignorance O
. O

I O
am O
by O
far O
and O
away O
no O
' O
greeny O
who O
wants O
to O
make O
everyone O
live O
in O
tipee B-INCORRECT
's B-INCORRECT
eat O
soya O
bean O
soup O
, B-INCORRECT
however B-INCORRECT
do O
agree O
that O
somthing B-INCORRECT
should O
be O
done O
about O
the O
volume O
of O
traffic O
is O
on O
our O
roads O
today O
. O

The O
governments B-INCORRECT
answer O
to O
the O
considerably O
growing O
amount O
of O
traffic O
on O
our O
roads O
it B-INCORRECT
just O
back O
move O
, B-INCORRECT
they B-INCORRECT
are O
not O
even O
attempting O
treat O
cause O
thent O
more O
and O
people O
now O
driving O
. O

We O
all O
feel O
that O
we O
have O
a O
divine O
right O
to O
be O
on O
the O
road O
. O

Why O
? O

Do O
we O
, O
the B-INCORRECT
westeren B-INCORRECT
world O
( O
5% O
of O
population O
) O
have O
right O
to O
use O
resources O
rest O
at O
environmental O
cost O
? O

Just O
beause B-INCORRECT
we O
can O
not O
be O
bothered O
to O
get O
out O
of O
bed O
a O
bit O
earilene B-INCORRECT
catch O
public O
transport O
. O

Even O
if O
we O
did O
, O
then O
shorly B-INCORRECT
so O
does O
the O
rest O
of O
world O
. O

That O
could O
have O
disasterous B-INCORRECT
implications O
. O

The O
2nd O
reason O
, B-INCORRECT
is O
the O
promblem B-INCORRECT
that O
public O
transport O
service O
for O
example O
rail O
declining O
so O
much O
there O
no O
train O
to O
catch O
in O
morning O
. O

People O
stopped O
using O
trains O
because O
of O
the O
fall O
in O
standards O
, B-INCORRECT
these B-INCORRECT
people O
were O
forced O
onto O
road O
routes O
became O
unprofitable O
and O
so O
closed O
services O
cut O
back O
forcing O
more O
roads O
. O

The O
whole O
system O
has O
now O
formed O
a O
spiraling O
circle O
of O
road O
use O
. O

This O
has O
now O
been O
intensifyed B-INCORRECT
with O
the O
sale O
of O
railways O
, B-INCORRECT
to O
privite B-INCORRECT
rail O
companys B-INCORRECT
profit O
motivated O
. O

The O
vital O
, B-INCORRECT
small O
rail O
links O
may O
now B-INCORRECT
be O
closed O
priviously B-INCORRECT
they O
where O
subsudised B-INCORRECT
to O
make O
up O
the O
loss O
privite B-INCORRECT
companies O
can O
not O
afford O
do O
this O
so B-INCORRECT
many O
will O
close O
cutting O
off O
towns O
and O
villages O
. O

The O
only O
way O
to B-INCORRECT
stop O
the B-INCORRECT
circle O
will O
be O
break O
it B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
people O
do O
this O
is O
government O
or O
ourselves O
If O
we O
make O
effort O
use O
public O
transport O
expand O
into O
a O
good O
service O
; B-INCORRECT
Unfortunatly B-INCORRECT
seam B-INCORRECT
appethetic B-INCORRECT
idea O
. O

Today O
, O
boxing O
has O
become O
a O
very O
popular O
sport O
with O
T.V. B-INCORRECT
channels O
competeing B-INCORRECT
for O
coverage O
of O
certain O
events O
and O
fighters O
earning O
lot O
money O
this O
is O
big O
business O
. O

Apart O
from B-INCORRECT
athletics O
, O
boxing O
seems O
to B-INCORRECT
be O
the O
only O
popular O
international O
sport O
which O
Britain O
can O
still O
hold O
head O
high O
. O

We O
have O
superb O
fighters O
with O
excellent O
character B-INCORRECT
such O
as O
Lennox O
Lewis O
, O
Nigel O
Benn O
Nasheem O
Hamed O
and O
our O
beloved O
Frank O
Bruno O
. O

Despite O
being O
enjoyable O
to O
watch O
, O
boxing O
is O
very O
dangerous O
. O

Blows O
to O
the O
head O
can O
cause O
brain O
rattle O
about O
skull O
which B-INCORRECT
may O
a O
clot O
or O
tumor O
. O

Last O
year O
, O
the O
fight O
between O
Chris O
Eubank O
and O
Micheal O
Watson O
led O
to O
calls O
for O
boxing O
be O
banned O
when O
slipped O
into O
a O
coma O
was O
in O
critical O
condition O
some O
months O
. O

Many O
youths O
in O
low O
income O
areas O
see O
boxing O
as O
' O
a O
way O
out O
, O
chance O
to O
make O
it O
the O
top O
and O
earn O
lot O
of O
money O
on O
. O

There O
are O
, O
however O
people O
who O
regard O
boxing O
as O
barbaric O
brutal O
and O
primitive O
. O

These O
people O
argue O
that O
there O
is O
no O
need O
for O
boxing O
and O
it O
only O
promotes O
violence O
. O

During O
the O
fight O
, O
yes O
of O
course O
it O
is O
violent O
but O
this O
controlled O
violence O
and O
fighters O
have O
a O
mutual O
respect O
for O
each O
other O
. O

All O
precautions O
are O
taken O
to O
ensure O
a O
safe O
fight O
. O

During O
fights O
doctors O
a B-INCORRECT
kept O
close O
to O
the O
ring O
and O
have O
authority O
call O
it O
off O
prematurely O
if O
required O
. O

Ambulances O
are O
also O
kept O
on O
stand O
by O
at O
big O
events O
. O

Although O
it O
may O
sound O
cruel O
, O
I O
do O
not O
beleive B-INCORRECT
that O
any O
fighter O
has O
entered O
a O
proffessional B-INCORRECT
boxing O
career O
without O
knowing O
the O
risks O
. O

Because O
there O
are O
so O
many O
budding O
young O
boxers O
, O
to O
ban O
boxing O
would O
be O
insane O
since O
it O
almost O
certainly O
go O
underground O
. O

Underground O
fights O
are O
far O
more O
dangerous O
since B-INCORRECT
less O
protective O
gear O
is O
used O
and O
there O
usually O
n't O
a O
doctor O
present O
. O

Taking O
this O
into O
account O
and O
considering O
that O
boxing O
is O
about O
hurting O
the O
opponent O
, O
it O
can O
be O
said O
a O
relatively O
safe O
sport O
. O

Although O
far O
less O
popular O
, O
there O
are O
other O
sports O
which O
more O
brutal O
and O
dangerous O
such O
as O
' O
Thai O
Boxing O
where O
competitors O
encourage B-INCORRECT
to O
use O
their O
knees O
elbows O
. O

The O
argument O
continues O
, O
but O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
safety O
in O
long O
term O
I B-INCORRECT
do O
not O
think O
boxing O
will O
be O
banned O
. O

Which O
is O
good O
news O
for O
the O
majority O
of O
British O
public O
. O

Two O
men O
, O
one O
ring O
only O
can O
leave O
. O
Dramatic O
it O
may O
be O
but B-INCORRECT
basically O
that O
is O
the O
main O
principal O
of O
boxing O

Although O
throughout B-INCORRECT
the O
years O
rules B-INCORRECT
have O
been O
made O
to O
dilute O
sports B-INCORRECT
sadistic O
side O
, O
should O
boxing O
be O
banned O
? O

Every O
time O
a O
boxer O
gets O
punched O
in O
the O
head O
his B-INCORRECT
brain O
moves O
vigorously O
inside O
skull O
. O

This O
causes O
the O
boxer O
to O
lose O
many O
brain O
cells O
per O
boxing O
fight O
and O
if O
this O
occurs O
frequently O
then B-INCORRECT
can O
end O
his O
career O
with O
damage O
. O

In O
my O
eyes O
and O
probably O
the O
of O
others O
this B-INCORRECT
is O
reason O
enough O
for O
banning O
boxing O
. O

The O
sport O
to B-INCORRECT
say O
the B-INCORRECT
least O
is B-INCORRECT
actually O
a O
blood O
, B-INCORRECT
simple O
reason O
being O
that O
idea O
of O
' O
knock O
your O
opposition O
out O
although O
this O
argued O
by O
Chris O
Eubank O
he B-INCORRECT
believes O
sportsman O
and O
boxing O
an O
art O
form O
says O
does O
not O
specifically O
go O
into O
ring O
his B-INCORRECT
opponent O
but B-INCORRECT
win O
on O
points O
differences O
give O
just B-INCORRECT
respect O
most B-INCORRECT
fights O
have O
been O
won O
. O

But O
there O
is O
one O
exception O
- O
the B-INCORRECT
original O
example O
, B-INCORRECT
first O
reference O
why B-INCORRECT
boxing O
should O
be O
banned O
tragic O
accident O
where O
Michael O
Watson O
was O
put O
into O
a O
coma O
by O
Chris O
Eubank O
( O
man O
who O
does O
n't O
specifically O
go O
fights O
to O
knock O
his O
opposition O
out O
) O
. O

This O
example O
only O
proves O
too O
well O
what O
a O
dangerous O
so O
called B-INCORRECT
' O
sport O
boxing O
is O
. O

The O
boxing O
federation O
is O
trying O
to O
do O
as O
much O
it O
can O
make O
the O
' O
spot B-INCORRECT
safer O
having B-INCORRECT
rungside B-INCORRECT
doctors O
, O
banning O
bare O
hand O
fights O
but B-INCORRECT
top O
and O
bottom O
of O
argument O
that O
any O
blow O
head O
causes O
considerable O
damage O
. O

There O
is O
always O
much O
speculation O
over O
the O
dangers O
of O
such O
a O
brutal O
sport O
as O
boxing O
. O

This O
is O
emphasised O
and O
exaggerated O
when O
a O
competitor O
in O
the O
sport O
tragically O
dies O
. O

A O
recent O
death O
in O
the B-INCORRECT
ring O
has O
inevitably O
led O
to O
a O
public O
uproar O
on O
safety O
of O
sport O
, O
and O
controvesy B-INCORRECT
over O
whether O
should O
be O
banned O
or O
not O
is O
yet O
again O
forefront O
discussion O
. O

Let O
us O
consider O
how O
a O
professional O
boxer O
would O
feel O
. O

He O
is O
clearly O
aware O
of O
the O
dangers O
and O
brutalism O
sport O
, O
which O
possibly O
why O
he O
enjoys O
it O
so O
much O
. O

I O
have O
yet O
to O
hear O
any O
boxer O
regret O
his O
choice O
of O
career O
. O

The O
excitement O
of O
being O
in O
the O
ring O
, O
joy O
at O
knocking O
an O
opponent O
onto O
canvass B-INCORRECT
and O
all O
money O
that O
is O
there O
to O
be O
made O
are O
overwhelming O
factors O
which O
keep O
boxers O
fighting O
. O

The O
money O
that O
is O
there O
for O
the O
taking O
very O
best O
of O
ridiculous O
, O
and O
with O
some O
top O
boxers O
earning O
sums O
such O
as O
£ O
20 O
million O
( O
or O
in O
Mike O
Tysons B-INCORRECT
comeback O
case O
$ O
60 O
! O
) O
it B-INCORRECT
hardly O
surprising O
how O
important O
sport O
can O
be O
to O
. O

Let O
us O
consider O
' B-INCORRECT
Sky O
viewes B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
recently O
beginning O
a O
subscription O
to O
view O
Tysons B-INCORRECT
" O
next O
Live O
Lights O
. O

This O
member O
of O
the O
public O
does O
not O
want O
sport O
to O
be O
banned O
either O
. O

Now O
let B-INCORRECT
us O
consider O
the O
friends O
or O
family O
of O
a O
boxer O
, B-INCORRECT
who O
has O
been O
permanently O
injured O
( O
killed O
due O
to O
fight O
) O
. O

These O
individuals O
and O
others O
learning O
about O
the O
tragic O
incident O
in O
media O
protest O
against O
sport O
. O

The O
family O
, O
who O
were O
originally O
against O
the O
idea O
of O
their O
son O
finishing O
college O
early O
to O
take O
up O
sport O
would B-INCORRECT
be O
leading O
protests O
againt B-INCORRECT
boxing O
. O

How O
pleased O
, B-INCORRECT
proud O
and O
patriotic O
the O
British O
public O
felt O
when O
Frank O
Bruno O
achieved O
his O
ultimate O
goal O
became O
Heavyweight B-INCORRECT
champion O
of O
world O
yet B-INCORRECT
how O
sorry O
many O
were O
to O
see O
him O
return O
boxing O
after O
head O
injuries O
earlier O
in O
career O
. O

This O
hypocritical O
view O
is O
shoved B-INCORRECT
by O
so O
many O
that O
whether O
boxing O
should O
be O
banned O
or O
not O
will O
remain O
a O
controversial O
issue O
for O
the O
forseeable B-INCORRECT
future O
. O

There O
were O
2 O
main O
objections O
raised O
against O
the O
introduction O
of O
national O
lottery O
. O

The O
first O
was O
the O
objection O
that O
lottery O
would O
be O
little O
more O
another B-INCORRECT
form O
of O
taxation O
, O
in O
fact O
none O
than O
a O
tax O
on O
poor O
. O

The O
second O
and O
main O
objection O
came O
from O
charities O
who O
predicted O
that O
charitable O
donations O
would O
go O
down O
with O
the O
introduction O
of O
lottery O
, O
as O
people O
be O
less O
likely O
to O
give O
money O
charity O
instead O
buying O
a O
ticket O
excuse O
some O
spent O
. O

There O
was O
also O
some O
controversy O
over O
the O
awarding O
of O
lottery O
organisation O
franchise O
, O
which O
eventually O
went O
to O
Camelot O
not O
seen O
as O
strongest O
contender O
for O
bid O
: O
other O
companies O
or O
consortiums O
promised O
give O
more O
money O
charity O
with O
lower O
running O
costs O
. O

Richard O
Bronson O
promised O
to O
give O
all O
of O
his O
profits O
charity O
, O
but O
was O
rejected O
. O

My O
personal O
objections B-INCORRECT
to O
Camelot O
as O
the O
lottery O
organiser O
is O
that O
a O
large O
proportion O
of O
consortium O
are O
american B-INCORRECT
or O
foreign O
firms O
, O
for O
example O
IBM O
has O
sizeable O
stake O
in O
. O

The O
British B-INCORRECT
national O
lottery O
run B-INCORRECT
by O
non O
firms O
. O

since B-INCORRECT
its O
introduction O
there B-INCORRECT
has O
been O
more O
controversy O
over O
the O
national O
lottery O
. O

When O
it O
promised O
to O
give O
45 O
pence O
in O
every O
pound O
charitable O
causes O
, O
neglected O
promise O
that O
most O
or O
all O
of O
this O
money O
would O
go O
charity O
. O

There O
has O
also O
been O
some O
controversy O
over O
the O
allocation O
of O
money O
. O

For O
example O
3 B-INCORRECT
million O
pounds O
were O
given O
to O
Eton O
college O
one B-INCORRECT
of O
the O
richest O
public O
schools O
for B-INCORRECT
a O
gymnasium O
money B-INCORRECT
was O
also O
royal O
opera O
house O
. O

The O
lottery O
seamed B-INCORRECT
to O
be O
a O
reverse O
Robin O
Hood O
: O
stealing O
from O
the O
poor O
give O
rich O
. O

The O
lottery O
has O
also O
suffered O
alegations B-INCORRECT
that O
it O
is O
addictive O
, O
especially O
with O
the O
introduction O
of O
scratch O
cards O
. O

It O
has O
been O
claimed O
that O
it O
is O
so O
addictive O
people O
will O
spend O
all O
their O
availiable B-INCORRECT
cash O
on O
lottery O
tickets O
, O
only O
to O
be O
disappointed O
. O

It O
has O
been O
calculated O
that O
only O
4 O
pence O
out O
of O
every O
pound O
recieved B-INCORRECT
by O
the B-INCORRECT
lottery O
goes O
to O
charitable O
causes O
, B-INCORRECT
rest O
is O
tax O
prize O
fund O
profits O
and O
so O
called B-INCORRECT
charities O
. O

It O
has O
also O
been O
calculated O
that O
the O
chance O
of O
winning O
anything O
substantial O
is O
one O
in O
millions O
, O
ie B-INCORRECT
highly O
unlikely O
. O

It O
has O
also O
been O
alleged O
that O
the O
jackpots O
are O
too O
high O
most B-INCORRECT
of O
lucky O
winners O
have O
said O
themselves O
jackpot O
had O
runed B-INCORRECT
their O
life O
, O
alenating B-INCORRECT
them O
from O
friends O
and O
family O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
I O
think O
that O
the O
lottery O
should O
be O
retained O
but O
not O
in O
its O
present O
form O
. O
jackpots O
capped O
at O
2 O
million O
pounds O
and O
prize O
fund O
shared O
between O
more O
people O
: O
it O
is O
better O
to O
give O
forteen B-INCORRECT
a O
fortune O
than O
fourteen O
fortunes O
one O
person O

I O
would O
also O
remove O
any O
american B-INCORRECT
buisness B-INCORRECT
interests O
and O
give O
the O
charity O
money O
to O
more B-INCORRECT
diserving B-INCORRECT
' O
. O

Now O
the O
lottery O
is O
in O
place O
, O
it O
would O
be O
very O
difficult O
to O
remove O
from O
society O
. O

The O
computer O
has O
been O
one O
of O
the O
most O
influential O
inventions O
all O
time O
. O

Computers O
now O
dominate O
the O
majority O
of O
government O
business O
, O
science O
and O
communication O
as O
well O
many O
other O
areas O

In O
many O
ways O

has O
taken O
the O
place O
of O
human O
brain O
in O
performing O
calculations O
and O
thought O
processes O
. O

The O
most O
obvious O
example O
of O
this O
is O
the O
calculator O
, O
an O
instrument O
used O
by O
mathmeticians B-INCORRECT
and O
scientists O
for O
making O
numerical O
calculations O
. O

This O
has O
made O
it O
no O
longer O
necessary O
for O
the B-INCORRECT
human B-INCORRECT
to O
perform O
calculations O
and O
run O
through O
equations O
, O
so O
need B-INCORRECT
not O
understand O
principles O
behind O
them O
any O
. O

This O
, O
unfortunately O
means O
that O
the O
genius O
scientist O
is O
being O
replaced O
by O
powerful O
computer O
and O
its O
operator O
who O
needs O
only O
to O
know O
which O
buttons O
press O
. O

This O
may O
seem O
an O
extreme O
view O
, O
as O
there O
is O
still O
much O
in O
the O
world O
of O
maths O
and O
science O
which O
a O
computer O
can O
not O
calculate O
but O
this O
be O
case O
centuries O
into O
future O
. O

Computers O
have O
been O
used O
as O
a O
means O
of O
keeping O
records O
, O
they O
all O
but O
superseded O
handwritten O

( O

Computer O

pictures O

to O
be O
more O
popular O
than O

a O

Whether O
or O
not O
the O
computer O
is O
taking O
over O
from O
human O
brain O
, O
it O
has O
certainly O
made O
body O
all O

redundant O

the O

that O

But O
for O

this O

I O
can O

that O

The O
development O
and O
implementation O
of O
technology O
has O
affected O
societies O
in O
every O
corner O
the O
world O
. O

I O
do O
not O
speak O
of O
a O
certain O
object O
in O
particular O
, O
but O
technology O
as O
whole O
. O

This O
thing O
, O
technology O
has B-INCORRECT
been O
and O
will O
always O
be O
both O
the O
closest O
friend O
yet O
greatest O
Nemesis O
of O
our O
world O
. O

Science O
and O
technology O
have O
allowed O
me O
to O
travel O
this O
part O
of O
the O
world O
, O
they O
provided O
a O
living O
for O
my O

in O

even O
less O
overt O
corners O
our O

. O

The O
use O
of O
the O
means O
humans O
have O
developed O
is O
wherein B-INCORRECT
greatest O
problems O
lie O
. O

Alone O
, O
they O
do O
not O
threaten O
us O
but O
when O
become O
welded O
with O
certain O
aspects O
of O
and O
people O
in O
our O
societies O
potentially O
the O
most O
dangerous O
things O
that O
we O
hold O
hands O
. O

Speaking O
from O
my O
experience O
living O
in O
the O
United O
States O
, O
I O
have O
come O
to O
feel O
that O
technology O
has O
become O
a O
large B-INCORRECT
detriment O
our O
youth O
particular O
. O

People O
say O
that O
technological O
development O
has O
made O
our O
world O
much O
smaller O
, O

and O
I O
would O
concur O
that O
a O
great O
majority O
of O
Americans O
live O
in O
their O
own O
personal O
closets O
. O

In O
schools O
, O
Geography O
classes O
rarely O
if O
ever O
exist O
. O

Before O
I O
came O
to O
Spain O
, O
a O
group O
of O
children O
asked O
me O
if O
was O
in O
Michigan O
. O

Explaining O
that O
Spain O
was O
located O
across O
the O
ocean O
did O
not O
seem O
to O
improve O
their O
understanding O
of O
layout O
our O
world O
. O

Science O
and O
technology O
have O
had O
effects O
on O
the O
U.S. O
that O
can O
not O
be O
described O
, O
I O
feel O
its O
people O
adopted O
same O
" O
am O
a B-INCORRECT
self O
- O
sufficient- B-INCORRECT
do O
n't O
need O
any O
help O
type O
of O
mentality O
will O
slowly O
destroy O
us O
. O

Our O
awareness O
of O
other O
people O
, O
cultures O
and O
languages O
is O
very O
low O
on O
the O
priority O
list O
our O
educators O
. O

Until O
I B-INCORRECT
was O
15 O
, O
unable O
to O
study O
any O
foreign O
language O
at O
all O
and O
even O
that O
time O
had O
only O
one O
choice O
of O
languages- B-INCORRECT
German O
. O

Since O
I O
was O
twelve O
, B-INCORRECT
had O
an O
intense O
desire O
to O
learn O
Spanish O
and O
because O
of O
these O
circumstances O
that O
mentioned O
before O
no O
choice O
but O
wait O
until O
twenty O
years O
old O
even O
begin O
this O
language O
. O

Mine O
is O
not O
the O
only O
experience O
like O
this O
. O

The O
effort O
of O
the O
United O
States O
has O
caused O
our O
minds O
to O
be O
heard O
, O
and O
a O
world O
that O
is O
growing O
while O
my O
country O
lags O
behind O
in O
its O
selfish O
self O
- O
satisfaction O
. O

Many O
people O
argue O
nowadays O
that O
, O
with O
the O
advent O
of O
computer O
technology O
our O
mental O
arithmetic O
is O
poor O
and O
we O
are O
becoming O
a O
nation O
couch O
potatos B-INCORRECT
. O

It O
is O
true O
in O
a O
way O
, B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
development O
of O
portable O
calculating O
machines O
( O
calculators O
) O
has O
meant O
that O
we O
no O
longer O
need O
to O
be O
able O
work O
out O
sums O
our O
heads O
but B-INCORRECT
at O
what O
cost O
? O

In O
many O
shops O
, O
the O
cashiers O
appear O
to O
be O
dumbfounded O
by O
simplest O
of O
sums O
without O
aid O
their O
tills O
. O

In O
many O
areas O
, O
the O
skill O
of O
human O
judgement O
has O
been O
replaced O
by O
faster O
more O
accurate O
computers O
. O

Many O
people O
have O
had O
their O
job O
positions O
taken O
over O
by O
computers O
. O

Filing O
cabinets O
are O
becoming O
a O
thing O
of O
the O
past O
with O
computer O
databases O
. O

But O
even O
such O
menial O
tasks O
as O
filing O
are O
good O
for O
us O
. O

They O
encourage O
organisational O
skills O
and O
tidiness O
. O

When O
people O
talk O
about O
artificial O
intelligence O
( O
AI O
) O
, O
you O
hear O
many O
funny O
tales O
from O
who O
are O
convinced O
that O
the O
computers O
coming O
alive O
and O
will O
eventually O
rule O
us O
. O

These O
are O
just O
the O
rantings O
of O
people O
who O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
computers O
and O
not O
realise O
that O
behind O
every O
computer O
is O
a O
programmer O
. O

Even O
' O
artificial O
intelligence O
needs O
to O
be O
programmed O
. O

Human O
brains O
still O
work O
out O
how O
to O
build O
the O
computers O
, O
program O
them O
and O
more O
importantly O
control O
. O

As O
for O
making O
the O
human O
brain O
redundant O
computers B-INCORRECT
can O
help O
to O
improve O
learning O
skills O
, O
they O
teach O
test O
and O
our O
linguistic O
. O

Reflexes O
are O
improved O
( O
and O
this O
has O
been O
scientifically O
proven O
) O
by O
playing O
computer O
games O
, O
the O
very O
same O
things O
that O
parents O
say O
turn O
their O
children O
into O
' O
zombies O
. O

We O
can O
expand O
our O
imagination O
and O
convert O
ideas O
into O
computer O
simulated O
models O
, O
enabling O
us O
to O
design O
buildings O
road O
networks O
. O

The O
computer O
revolution O
has O
not O
made O
our O
brains O
redundant O
, O
it O
opened O
up O
areas O
of O
them O
we O
never O
knew O
existed O
! O

It O
is O
now O
the O
age O
of O
computer O
. O

Almost O
everyone O
owns O
a O
computer O
or O
has O
access O
to O
one O
. O

Computers O
nowadays O
are O
a O
far O
cry O
from O
the O
one O
's B-INCORRECT
in O
past O
which O
filled O
whole O
rooms O
. O

They O
are O
able O
to O
generate O
amazingly O
accurate O
graphical O
representations O
and O
perform O
extremely O
difficult O
mathematical O
equations O
in O
just O
seconds O
. O

Computers O
have O
become O
a O
huge O
part O
of O
our O
lives O
in O
both O
the O
areas O
work O
and O
education O
. O

But O
are O
they O
such O
a O
good O
thing O
? O

When O
calculators O
came O
along O
a B-INCORRECT
drop O
in O
ability B-INCORRECT
of O
students O
for B-INCORRECT
mental O
arithmetic O
was O
obvious O
and O
now O
they O
are O
used O
the O
simplest O
calculations O
. O

The O
computer O
could O
do O
the O
same O
thing O
. O

Computers O
encourage O
laziness O
in O
the O
general O
public O
, B-INCORRECT
why O
work O
out O
something O
yourself O
when O
computer O
can O
do O
it O
for O
you O
. B-INCORRECT

This O
is O
very O
time O
saving B-INCORRECT
and O
efficient O
but O
it O
causing O
people O
to O
forget O
basic O
ideas O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
spelling O
is O
no O
longer O
as O
important O
it O
was O
you B-INCORRECT
can O
simply O
use O
a O
" O
spellcheck O
to O
correct O
your O
English O
which O
absurd O
. O

For O
the O
youth O
of O
today O
computers B-INCORRECT
offer O
links O
around O
world O
and O
millions O
facts O
figures O
. O

This O
could O
be O
argued O
to O
educational O
. O

However O
, O
this O
is O
killing O
the O
imagination O
of O
children O
and O
they O
spend O
hours O
sat O
at O
a O
keyboard O
tapping O
away O
in O
doom O
gloom O
house O
. O

They O
should O
be O
out O
enjoying O
themselves O
and O
gaining O
experiences O
for O
instead O
of O
reading O
about O
them O
on O
a O
flat O
screen O
. O

It O
is O
said O
that O
you O
can O
meet O
people O
through O
computers O
and O
have O
' O
relationships O
. O

I O
find O
this O
preposterous O
and O
people O
are O
losing O
the O
ability O
to O
communicate O
form O
relationships O
. O

Computers O
can O
offer O
escape O
from O
the O
hum B-INCORRECT
- B-INCORRECT
drum B-INCORRECT
routine O
of O
daily O
life O
by O
means O
games O
but B-INCORRECT
they O
are O
mind O
numbing O
and O
un B-INCORRECT
inventive B-INCORRECT
. O

There O
is O
however B-INCORRECT
a B-INCORRECT
more O
dangerous O
threat O
from O
computers O
, B-INCORRECT
it B-INCORRECT
that O
they O
can O
do O
the O
work O
for B-INCORRECT
man B-INCORRECT
. O

This O
could O
lead O
to O
high O
unemployment O
. O

Those O
people O
who O
work O
with O
computers O
for O
long O
periods O
of O
time O
every O
day O
face O
problems O
. O

The O
repetion B-INCORRECT
of O
tapping O
keys O
all O
day O
and O
staring O
at O
the O
screen O
can O
be O
harmful O
not B-INCORRECT
only O
that O
it B-INCORRECT
is O
highly O
boring O
to O

what O

would O
hardly O
ever O
talk O
and O
the O
only O
career O
available O
computer O
programmers O
. O

I O
agree O
that O
computers O
are O
helpful O
but O
people O
should O
not O
live O
through O
their O
and O
be O
so O
reliant O
on O
them O
. O

They O
should O
read O
books O
and O
live O
more O
in O
order O
to O
regain O
their O
lost O
imagination O
sense O
of O
adventure O
. O

Also O
, O
in O
schools O
I B-INCORRECT
feel O
that O
work O
should O
be O
done O
mainly O
by O
hand O
and O
calculators O
computers O
only O
used O
minimally O
mathematics O
order O
to O
stop O
the O
production O
of O
computer O
addicts O
again B-INCORRECT
have B-INCORRECT
normal B-INCORRECT
people B-INCORRECT
. O

There O
are O
many O
beneficial O
aspects O
of O
genetic O
manipulation O
. O

These O
include O
: B-INCORRECT
the O
erasion O
of O
identification O
harmful O
hereditary O
genetic O
disorders O
and O
development O
hybrid O
high O
- O
yield O
crops O
. O

There O
can O
be O
no O
doubt O
that O
genetic O
manipulation O
and O
engineering O
have O
had O
highly O
beneficial O
effects O
on O
many O
areas O
of O
society O
. O

However O
, O
many O
people O
dislike O
or O
are O
prejudiced O
against O
genetic O
manipulation O
. O

Partly O
this B-INCORRECT
is O
a O
' O
Fear O
of O
the O
unknown O
; O
something O
which O
tampers O
with O
intrinsic O
components O
plant O
and O
animal O
life O
beyond O
comprehension O
for O
most O
people O
, O
therefore O
provokes O
fear O
. O

What O
people O
have O
also O
become O
aware O
of O
, O
is O
the O
immense O
power O
which B-INCORRECT
genetic O
manipulation O
can O
give O
to O
certain O
individuals O
. O

This O
has O
been O
very O
good O
to O
feed O
popular O
culture O
( O
the O
film O
' O
Jurassic O
Park O
being O
an O
obvious O
reference O
point O
) O
. O

There O
is O
also O
however B-INCORRECT
, O
the O
very O
real O
possibility O
that O
power O
of O
genetic O
manipulation O
could O
become O
possession O
uncontrolled O
unregulated B-INCORRECT
individuals O
who O
use O
it O
for O
' O
evil O
purposes O
. O

This O
then B-INCORRECT
, O
is O
an O
argument O
against O
scientists O
bearing O
moral O
responsibility O
for O
their O
work O
. O

Anything O
in O
life O
can O
be O
misused O
. O

Whether O
it O
be O
a O
kitchen O
- B-INCORRECT
knife O
used O
to O
stab O
someone O
, O
car O
run O
over O
or O
something O
as O
harmeless B-INCORRECT
pillow O
suffocate O
. O

Everything O
in O
life O
, O
if O
misused O
can O
have O
harmful O
effects O
and O
genetic O
engineering O
manipulation O
are O
no O
exception O
. O

Though O
the O
possible O
effects O
of O
genetic O
manipulation O
may O
be O
far O
larger B-INCORRECT
than O
a O
kitchen O
- O
knife O
or O
car O
, O
this O
is O
purely O
subjective O
view O
by O
present O
day O
standards O
. O

Certainly O
we B-INCORRECT
would O
not O
hold O
the O
makers O
of O
a O
car O
or O
kitchen O
- B-INCORRECT
knife O
responsible O
for O
their O
misuse O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
reason O
why O
scientists O
should O
bear O
major O
burden O
responsibility O
if O
genetic O
manipulation O
put O
to O
. O

The O
fundamental O
flaw O
in O
saying O
scientists O
must O
bear O
the O
major O
burden O
or O
moral O
responsibility O
for O
their O
work O
, O
is O
that O
if O
this O
had O
been O
applied O
universally O
centuries O
scientific O
research O
would O
never O
have O
taken O
place O
and O
mankind O
be O
without O
electricity O
radios O
quite O
simply O
anything O
above O
mud O
hut O
' B-INCORRECT
existence O
. O

Scientific O
research O
is O
not O
a O
corrupt O
, O
but O
an O
essential O
and O
natural O
part B-INCORRECT
of O
the O
human O
condition O
for O
bettering O
itself O
. O

The O
other O
fundamental O
flaw O
is O
assuming O
that O
individual O
scientists O
have O
responsibility O
, O
Science O
a O
process O
of O
discovery O
rather O
than O
creation O
ie O
. O

no O
- O
one O
created O
genetic O
manipulation O
, O
the O
power O
of O
it O
was O
there O
to O
be O
discovered O
. O

If O
one O
scientist O
does O
not O
make O
a O
discovery O
then B-INCORRECT
another O
will O
. O

It O
is O
unfair O
to O
hold O
responsible O
the O
scientist O
on B-INCORRECT
fore B-INCORRECT
front B-INCORRECT
of O
human O
knowledge O
, O
who O
discovers O
something O
when O
another O
in O
part O
world O
may O
make O
discovery O
independently O
afterwards O
. O

The O
only O
argument O
for O
making O
scientists O
responsible O
their O
work O
, O
is O
that O
quite O
often O
and O
particularly O
in O
the O
case O
of O
genetic O
manipulation O
it O
would O
need O
a O
scientist O
to O
misuse O
knowledge O
therefore O
they O
should O
be O
. O

While O
genetic O
manipulation O
is O
relatively O
new O
, O
it O
takes O
a O
scientist O
to O
carry O
out O
and O
therefore O
an O
individual O
could O
be O
held O
responsible O
. O

But O
, O
once O
genetic O
manipulation O
becomes O
common B-INCORRECT
- B-INCORRECT
place B-INCORRECT
in O
the O
future O
and O
it O
is O
not O
only O
domain O
of O
scientists O
originals B-INCORRECT
scientist O
who O
discovered O
can O
be O
held O
responsible O
for O
other O
's B-INCORRECT
misuse O
. O

There O
are O
many O
problems O
facing O
the O
Monarchy B-INCORRECT
. O

Some O
of O
them O
are O
listed O
below O
: O

The O
divisions O
in O
their O
family O
and O
the B-INCORRECT
fight O
between O
prince B-INCORRECT
princes B-INCORRECT
of O
Wales O
possibility O
divorce O
. O

The O
other O
problem O
is O
that O
people O
say O
( O
or O
think O
) O
they O
do O
not O
anything O
but O
are O
rich O
and O
also O
pay O
any O
taxes O
. O

Another O
problem O
is O
that O
people O
think O
Monarchy B-INCORRECT
abolishing B-INCORRECT
in O
many O
countries O
and O
are O
republic B-INCORRECT
so O
should O
be O
abolished O
this O
country O
too B-INCORRECT
. O

There O
are O
also O
arguments O
against O
abolishing O
the O
Monarchy B-INCORRECT
too B-INCORRECT
. O

For O
example O
many B-INCORRECT
people O
like O
the O
royal O
family O
or B-INCORRECT
they O
are O
honest O
not B-INCORRECT
politisions B-INCORRECT
that B-INCORRECT
always O
lay B-INCORRECT
. O

I O
think O
the O
royal O
family O
and O
Monarchy B-INCORRECT
is O
a B-INCORRECT
tradition O
in O
UK B-INCORRECT
anywhere O
world O
, B-INCORRECT
known O
by B-INCORRECT
its O
so O
do O
not O
it O
should O
be O
abolished O
. O

In O
the O
end O
I B-INCORRECT
think O
if O
many O
people O
want O
Monarchy B-INCORRECT
to O
be O
ablished B-INCORRECT
a O
general O
election O
should O
called O
and O
then O
see B-INCORRECT
abolished O
. O

" O
In O
Vitro O
fertilisation O
is O
the O
of O
an O
egg O
in O
laboratory O
ie O
. O
a O
testube B-INCORRECT

The O
egg O
is O
taken O
from O
the O
mother O
and O
placed O
in O
an O
environment O
which O
will O
optimise O
chances O
of O
fertilisation O
by O
sperm O
father O
. O

Once O
fertilisation O
has O
occured B-INCORRECT
the O
fertilised O
egg O
is O
implanted O
back O
into O
mothers B-INCORRECT
womb O
and O
from O
there O
on O
pregnancy O
will O
be O
normal O
. O

Normally O
more B-INCORRECT
than O
1 O
egg O
is O
taken O
from O
the O
mother O
so O
that O
eggs O
can O
be O
stored O
and O
used O
later O
if O
pregnancy O
unsuccesful B-INCORRECT
or O
one O
fertilised O
at O
same O
time O
to O
increase O
chance O
of O
a O
succesful B-INCORRECT
. O

This O
usually O
leads O
to O
multiple O
births O
ie O
. O

twins O
, O
triplets O
etc O
. O

There O
are O
people O
who O
agains B-INCORRECT
this O
, O
saying O
it O
is B-INCORRECT
not O
natural O
and O
fair O
to O
the O
child O
having B-INCORRECT
started O
life O
in O
a O
test O
tube O
as O
they O
believe O
starts O
from O
moment O
of O
conception O
. O

There O
are O
ethics O
involved O
whereby B-INCORRECT
who O
is O
given O
the O
treatment O
and O
n't O
? B-INCORRECT

, O
at O
what O
age O
should O
the O
treatment O
not O
be O
given O
and O
is O
it O
justifiable O
to O
spend O
so O
much O
money O
on O
in O
vitro O
fertilisation O
for B-INCORRECT
one O
person O
when O
same O
amount O
of O
could O
used O
saves O
hundereds B-INCORRECT
lives O
by O
vaccinating O
people O
against O
measles O
example O
. O

The O
people O
who O
are O
for O
this O
can O
argue O
by O
saying O
that O
it O
is O
the O
right O
of O
every O
person O
to O
have O
their O
own O
child O
. O

Women O
who O
would O
not O
normally O
be O
able O
to O
have O
children O
can O
now O
do O
so O
with O
invitro B-INCORRECT
fertilisation O
. O

Through O
no O
fault O
of O
her O
own O
she B-INCORRECT
could O
have O
a O
blocked O
fallopian O
tube O
causing O
to O
be O
unable O
allow O
eggs O
down O
the O
womb O
and O
it O
is O
only O
fair O
in B-INCORRECT
helping B-INCORRECT
children O
. O

Technology O
has O
progressed O
quickly O
and O
in B-INCORRECT
doing O
so O
ethics B-INCORRECT
practical O
guidelines O
have O
been O
left O
behind O
. O

I O
therefore O
think O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
have O
certain O
regulations O
ie B-INCORRECT
. O

1 O
. O
Fertility O
treatment O
should O
not O
be O
given O
to O
post O
- O
menopausal O
women O

The O
menopause O
is O
the O
body O
's O
way O
of O
telling O
you O
that O
are O
to B-INCORRECT
old O
and O
your O
no O
long O
capable O
bearing O
a O
baby O
. O

Last O
year O
there O
was B-INCORRECT
a O
case O
of O
post B-INCORRECT
menopausal O
woman O
who O
by B-INCORRECT
lying O
about O
her O
age O
given O
in O
vitro O
fertilisation O
( O
IVF O
) O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
this O
is O
fair O
or O
morally O
correct O
to O
the O
child O
since B-INCORRECT
her O
mother O
would O
be O
claiming O
pension O
when O
she O
was O
at O
primary O
school O
and O
probably O
die O
while O
in O
teens O
.... O
there B-INCORRECT
should O
a O
test O
that O
given O
before O
( O
IVF O
) O
carried O
out O

not O
past O

Eggs O
should O
not O
be O
taken O
from O

foetuses O
. O

The O
foetuses O
will O
have O
been O
aborted O
for O
a O
reason O
example O
: O
if O
it O
was O
the O
result O
of O
rape O
or O
had O
congenital O
deformities O
. O

There O
should O
be O
a O
guideline O
or O
law O
stating O
that O
eggs O
only O
taken O
from O
the O
mother O
and O
not O
dead O
, B-INCORRECT
foetuses O
. O

Science O
has O
moved O
on O
dramatically O
since O
the O
C19th O
. O

Many O
new O
things O
have O
been O
invented O
and O
many O
medically O
changed O
. O

People O
in O
our O
modern O
times O
are O
now O
able O
to O
have O
liver O
, B-INCORRECT
heart O
and O
even O
lung O
transplants O
there B-INCORRECT
many O
complications O
but O
succesful B-INCORRECT
. O

People O
are O
able O
to O
have O
a O
whole O
new O
blood O
supply O
if O
theirs O
lacks O
the O
sufficient O
requirements O
or B-INCORRECT
, B-INCORRECT
bone O
marrow O
transplant O
white O
cells O
. O

All O
the O
above O
are O
carried O
out O
on O
living O
people O
, O
but O
nowadays O
biological O
operations O
can O
be O
humans O
which O
not O
even O
born O
. O

Bodies O
can O
start O
their O
days O
in O
a O
test O
tubes B-INCORRECT
. O

This O
is O
called O
' O
in O
vitro O
fertilisation O
. O

This O
is O
when O
an O
egg O
removed O
from O
a O
woman O
placed B-INCORRECT
in B-INCORRECT
test O
tube O
and B-INCORRECT
then O
sperm O
to B-INCORRECT
the O
fuse O
together O
. O

The O
test O
tube O
is O
then O
incubated O
for O
a O
few O
weeks O
and O
when O
the B-INCORRECT
fetous B-INCORRECT
formed O
, O
baby O
inserted O
back O
in B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
mother O
. O

The O
fetous B-INCORRECT
is O
left O
to O
grow O
and O
develop O
naturally O
. O

This O
idea O
is O
extremely O
benificial B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
married O
couples O
who O
have O
been O
trying O
for O
a O
baby O
but O
unsuccesful B-INCORRECT
are O
able O
children O
. O

An B-INCORRECT
in B-INCORRECT
vitro O
fertilisation O
allows O
the O
baby O
to O
grow O
inside O
, B-INCORRECT
which O
mother O
and O
bond O
it O
would O
feel O
apart B-INCORRECT
of O
her O
this B-INCORRECT
not O
happen O
if O
couple O
adopted O
. O

What O
I O
do O
feel O
is O
ethically O
incorrect O
when O
a O
woman O
who O
post O
- O
menopausal O
decides O
she O
wants O
baby O
. O

Nature O
has O
already O
taken O
its O
course O
to O
tell O
her O
she O
is O
too O
old O
have O
any O
children O
so B-INCORRECT
why O
should O
one O
implanted O
into O
. O

It O
is O
not O
fair O
on O
the O
child O
because B-INCORRECT
when O
it O
grows O
up O
and O
all O
its O
friends O
are O
playing O
with O
their O
30 O
- O
40 O
year B-INCORRECT
old B-INCORRECT
parents O
, O
mother O
could O
be O
drawing O
her O
pension O
I O
am O
sure O
she O
would O
feel O
like O
. O

Also O
the B-INCORRECT
mother O
may O
die O
of O
old O
age O
before O
child O
has O
led O
a O
full O
life O
and O
this O
would O
be O
unfair O
to O
. O

The O
child O
may O
also O
have O
to O
look O
after O
the O
mother O
in O
her O
old O
age O
. O

As O
the O
fetous B-INCORRECT
begins O
its O
life O
in O
a O
test O
tube O
, O
and O
sperm O
is O
selected O
this O
means O
that O
sex O
of O
could O
also O
be O
. O

The O
way O
the O
sex O
can O
be O
chosen O
is O
by O
using O
genetics O
. O

The O
women B-INCORRECT
has O
2 O
X O
chromosomes B-INCORRECT
and O
the O
man O
one O
a O
Y O
- O
. O

The O
way O
in O
which O
the O
sex O
can O
be O
selected O
is O
that O
egg O
always O
X O
and O
sperms B-INCORRECT
nucleus O
either O
contain O
an O
or O
a O
Y O
chromosome O
. O

The O
X O
chromosome O
sperm O
is O
slightly O
heavier O
than O
the O
Y O
so B-INCORRECT
they O
can O
be O
separated O
. O

If O
the O
mother O
wants O
a O
boy O
Y B-INCORRECT
sperm O
is O
selected O
and B-INCORRECT
if O
girl O
X B-INCORRECT
. O

This O
may O
lead O
to O
an O
increase O
in O
one O
sex O
, O
and O
a O
decline O
the O
other O
. O

As O
a O
result O
this B-INCORRECT
would O
reduce O
the O
population O
as O
there O
be O
less B-INCORRECT
couples O
. O

Also O
what B-INCORRECT
happens O
if O
most O
people O
the O
year O
you O
are O
born O
men O
and O
a O
woman O
, B-INCORRECT
this B-INCORRECT
would O
be O
unpopular O
sex O
. O

Science O
is O
progressing O
all O
the O
time O
, O
but O
it O
for O
best O
? O

The O
main O
reason O
for O
the O
people O
of O
Britain O
to O
stop O
eating O
beef O
at O
moment O
is O
threat O
BSB B-INCORRECT
. O

This O
is O
a O
viral O
disease O
that O
attacks O
the O
central O
nervous O
system O
which O
can O
be O
passed O
on O
through O
consumsuming B-INCORRECT
animal O
. O

In O
cows O
it B-INCORRECT
is O
commonly O
know B-INCORRECT
as O
mad O
cow O
disease O
and O
by B-INCORRECT
law O
any B-INCORRECT
showing O
these O
signs O
must O
be O
destroyed O
not O
sold O
for O
meat O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
however B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
signs O
are O
not O
shown O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
this O
being O
viral O
disease O
. O

It O
can O
be O
passed O
on O
to O
humans O
through O
eating O
parts O
of O
the O
animal O
such O
as O
brain O
which O
is O
affected O
and O
these O
are O
usually O
sold O
put O
into O
fast O
foods O
beef B-INCORRECT
burgers B-INCORRECT
. O

The O
rest O
of O
the O
meat O
however B-INCORRECT
is B-INCORRECT
relatively O
safe O
and O
eating O
, O
e.g. O
a B-INCORRECT
steak O
offers O
very O
little O
chance O
disease O
being O
passed O
on O
. O

However O
the B-INCORRECT
British O
press O
has O
ignored O
this O
fact O
and O
blown O
situation O
out O
of O
proportion O
considering O
only O
a O
very O
small O
number O
people O
have O
died O
disease O
after O
lifetime O
eating O
beef O
. O

Another O
reason O
for O
the O
British O
people O
to O
stop O
eating O
beef O
is O
push O
vegetarianism O
, O
although O
this O
a O
much O
smaller O
threat O
trade O
than O
former O
point O
abut B-INCORRECT
BSB B-INCORRECT
. O

These O
factors O
could O
have O
a O
considerable O
impact O
on O
the O
agricultural O
industry O
preventing B-INCORRECT
sale O
of O
British O
dairy O
livestock O
not O
only O
in O
Britain O
but O
for O
export O
aswell B-INCORRECT
. O

With O
global O
communications O
as O
good O
they O
are O
now O
, O
it O
could O
send O
a O
scare O
across O
the O
world O
about O
British O
Beef O
- O
indeed O
France B-INCORRECT
and O
Germany O
already O
have O
restricted O
someplaces B-INCORRECT
banned O
sale O
or O
import O
of B-INCORRECT
beef O
for B-INCORRECT
fear B-INCORRECT
's B-INCORRECT
safety O
. O

Although O
British O
farmers O
have O
learned O
to O
diversits B-INCORRECT
, O
Dairy B-INCORRECT
farming O
and O
the O
sale O
of O
Beef B-INCORRECT
products O
still O
forms O
backbone O
agriculture O
would O
completely O
change O
face O
in O
Britain O
. O

Wether B-INCORRECT
they O
switch O
to O
sheep O
or O
vegetable O
crops O
were B-INCORRECT
made B-INCORRECT
, O
substantial O
changes O
would O
be O
needed O
change O
the O
situation O
. O

People O
throughout O
the O
United O
Kingdom O
were O
, O
doubtless O
shocked O
and O
perhaps O
upset O
by O
images O
in O
national O
press O
television O
news O
of O
cows O
who O
had O
contracted O
disease O
bovine O
spungiform O
encephalapthy B-INCORRECT
or O
BSE O
. O

The O
so O
- O
called O
' O
mad O
cow O
disease O
seemed O
to O
make O
the O
cows O
lose O
all O
sense O
of O
balance O
and O
direction O
, O
stumbling O
around O
drunkenly O
. O

Herds O
where O
this O
disease O
was O
found O
were O
put O
down O
before O
the O
symptoms O
progressed O
further O
. O

Those O
cows O
which O
had O
been O
put O
down O
were O
not O
used O
for O
food O
. O

The O
disease O
infects O
the O
cow O
, O
and O
is O
then O
present O
in O
spinal O
fluid O
within O
spine O
brain O
as O
usually O
spilt O
slaughter O
of O
cattle O
for O
meat O
risk O
contamination O
was O
one O
industry O
not O
willing O
to O
take O
. O

The O
human O
disease O
, O
Crentzfeld O
- O
Jacob O
or O
CJD O
is O
believed O
to O
be O
a O
form O
of O
BSE O
although O
no O
clear O
link O
has O
yet O
been O
established O
between O
the O
two O
. O

It O
is O
unclear O
whether O
incidence O
of O
CJD O
on O
the O
rise O
, O
or O
awareness O
condition O
heightened O
but O
more O
cases O
from O
all O
ages O
have B-INCORRECT
been O
diagnosed O
recently O
and O
disease O
always O
fatal O
. O

The O
government O
insists O
, O
perhaps O
correctly O
that O
British O
beef O
is O
perfectly O
safe O
to O
eat O
. O

However O
, O
people O
are O
genuinely O
scared O
of O
the O
presence O
disease O
in O
U.K. O
and O
many O
abstaining O
from O
eating O
beef O
. O

Many O
schools O
have O
removed O
beef O
from O
their O
menus O
, O
substituting O
pork O
and O
chicken O
sales O
of O
shown O
a O
decline O
. O

The O
implications O
for O
the O
beef O
industry O
could O
be O
rather O
serious O
, O
where B-INCORRECT
everybody O
to O
boycott O
products O
. O

To O
compensate O
, B-INCORRECT
beef O
prices O
have O
dropped O
in O
attempts O
to O
sell O
more O
meat O
but O
the O
public O
remains O
sceptical O
. O

If O
beef O
continues O
to O
fall O
from O
favour O
, O
then O
the O
industry O
's O
future O
would O
be O
unclear O
. O

Beef O
products O
are O
present O
in O
many O
foodstuffs O
such O
as O
jellies O
, O
fruit O
gums O
and O
of O
course O
stock B-INCORRECT
cubes O
. O

Would O
all O
these O
products O
have O
to O
find O
synthetic O
or O
substitute O
ingredients O
? O

Even O
if O
the O
entire O
beef O
industry O
were O
to O
grind O
a O
halt O
, O
numerous O
heads O
of O
cattle O
worldwide O
would O
no O
longer O
be O
needed O
but O
being O
bred O
as O
they O
are O
for O
useless O
milk O
products O
. O

Not O
all O
beef O
can O
be O
infected O
, O
though O
and O
the O
situation O
has O
become O
a O
waiting O
game O
. O

For O
beef O
to O
be O
repreived B-INCORRECT
or O
condemned O
, O
we O
are O
forced O
turn O
the O
scientists O
establish O
whether O
not O
BSE O
and O
CJD O
linked O
more O
importantly O
latter O
can O
contracted O
by O
eating O
meat O
contaminated O
with O
former O
. O

The O
nation O
awaits O
the O
verdict O
on O
tenterhooks O
, O
and O
it O
is O
in O
majority O
's O
interests O
that O
there O
be O
no O
proven O
link O
. O

Watch O
this O
space O
. O

Personally O
, O
I O
believe O
that O
it O
is O
merely O
man O
better O
at O
diagnosing O
CJD O
now O
than O
ever O
before O
. O

Some O
reports O
say O
that O
it O
can O
take O
up O
to O
20 O
years O
develop O
, O
so O
we O
could O
all O
already O
have O
. O

Whatever O
you O
believe O
, O
I O
shall O
continue O
to O
enjoy O
my O
roast O
beef O
and O
Yorkshire O
pudding O
thankyou B-INCORRECT
. O

There O
has O
been O
a O
big O
scare O
in O
Britain O
recently O
that O
some O
beef O
may O
contain O
BSE O
( O
bovine O
spongiform O
encephalopathy O
) O
which O
lead O
to O
the O
human O
equivalent O
of O
CJD O
Creutzfeldts O
- O
Jacob O
disease O
. O

BSE O
is O
a O
disease O
in O
cows O
that O
effects B-INCORRECT
their O
brain O
and O
spiral B-INCORRECT
tissue O
( O
or O
offal O
as O
it O
sometimes O
known O
) O
. O

After O
a O
few O
reported O
cases O
of O
CJD O
, O
similar O
form O
the O
disease O
found O
in O
humans O
it O
is O
know B-INCORRECT
thought O
that O
' O
mad O
- O
cow O
( O
BSE O
) O
cause O
. O

Researchers O
believe O
that O
eating O
beef O
containing O
offal O
will O
transmit O
the O
fatal O
disease O
to O
humans O
. O

This O
claim O
has O
devestated B-INCORRECT
the O
British O
beef O
industry O
as O
people O
are O
now O
too O
scared O
to O
eat O
in O
case O
they O
contract O
illness O
. O

Already O
the O
sales O
of O
beef O
in O
America O
have O
dropped O
by O
about O
15 B-INCORRECT
% B-INCORRECT
and O
Britain O
they O
6 B-INCORRECT
- O
7 B-INCORRECT
. O

Although O
scientists O
say O
that O
to O
contract O
CJD O
part B-INCORRECT
of O
the O
cows B-INCORRECT
offal O
must O
be O
contained O
within O
beef O
. B-INCORRECT

customers O
are O
still O
reluctant O
to O
eat O
the O
meat O
incase B-INCORRECT
it O
has O
come O
from O
some O
' O
dodgy O
butcher O
trying O
cut O
costs O
. O

As O
you O
can O
imagine O
this B-INCORRECT
has O
had O
a O
tremendous O
inffluence B-INCORRECT
on O
sales O
in O
places O
such O
as O
fast O
food O
restaurants O
where B-INCORRECT
beefburgers O
are O
the O
main O
item O
menu O
. O

An O
example O
of O
one O
is O
MacDonalds O
where B-INCORRECT
they O
have O
immediately O
brought O
out O
a O
notice O
stating O
that O
their O
beefburgers O
are O
made O
from O
100% O
the O
finest O
, O
pure O
beef O
and O
contain O
no O
offal O
. O

In O
my O
views B-INCORRECT
no O
half O
decent O
restaurant O
with O
a O
good O
reputation O
would O
risk O
buying O
poor O
beef O
in O
case O
customer O
caught O
CJD O
and O
they O
managed O
to O
trace O
it O
back O
the O
. O

An O
outcome O
like O
this O
would O
mean O
they O
be O
sued O
for O
several O
thousands O
of O
pounds O
and O
probably O
have O
to O
sell O
up O
. O

As O
a O
result O
of O
lower O
beef O
demand O
in O
places O
food O
production O
there B-INCORRECT
would O
be O
need O
for O
cows O
. O

This O
means O
that O
there O
would O
be O
an O
excess O
of O
beef O
( O
or O
a O
mountain O
) O
could O
not O
sold O
. O

Because O
of O
this O
the B-INCORRECT
prices O
beef O
would O
have O
to O
decrease O
in O
order O
attract O
more O
customers O
. O

So O
, O
as B-INCORRECT
a O
result O
of O
the O
claim O
that O
beef O
containing O
contaminated O
offal O
may O
cause O
CJD O
in O
humans O
farmers O
( O
particular O
) O
are O
losing O
out O
they O
will O
have O
to O
sell O
their O
meat O
for O
lower O
price O
due O
low O
demand O
. O

As O
a O
result O
they B-INCORRECT
may O
have O
to O
diversify O
towards B-INCORRECT
other O
areas O
such O
as O
crops O
, O
milking O
cows O
etc O
. O
or O
even O
get O
government O
subsidy O

I O
feel O
that O
the O
evidence O
BSE O
causes O
CJD O
was O
not O
strong O
enough O
before O
claims O
were O
released O
. O

It O
has O
therefore O
caused O
an O
unnecessary O
, O
deleterious O
effect O
on O
the O
agricultural O
industry O
and O
beef O
market O
. O

The O
question O
of O
compensation O
for O
services O
rendered O
is O
never O
so O
simple O
as O
remitting O
a O
predetermined O
salary O
based O
on O
qualifications O
and O
person O
's O
dedication O
to O
the O
task O
at O
hand O
. O

If O
one O
has O
preconceived O
notions O
concerning O
's O
salary O
, O
will O
certainly O
be O
disappointed O
since O
some O
employers O
are O
sure O
to O
value O
their O
skills O
and O
abilities O
less O
than O
others O
. O
" O

Contribution O
to O
society O
" O
is O
subjective O
and O
therefore O
impossible O
compensate O
equally O
' O
. O

In O
the O
1920s O
in O
American B-INCORRECT
, O
it O
became O
very O
popular O
to O
disdain O
people O
who O
did O
not O
actually O
work O
for O
a O
living O
but O
merely O
lived O
off O
interest O
of B-INCORRECT
their O
investments O
. O

The O
stock O
market O
was O
experiencing O
a O
boom O
, O
and O
several O
formerly O
working O
- O
class O
citizens O
became O
wealthy O
relished O
the O
idea O
of O
retiring O
early O
. O

But O
several O
great O
authors O
of O
that O
period O
questioned O
the O
right O
these O
investors O
to O
effectively O
live O
as O
parasites O
; O
they O
received O
money O
, O
but O
contributed O
nearly O
nothing O
society O
. O

People O
who O
inherit O
money O
or O
live O
off O
the O
interest O
of O
investors B-INCORRECT
often O
seem O
to O
spend O
their O
time O
in O
search O
a O
new O
thrill O
, O
some O
sort O
excitement O
that O
can O
not O
buy O
. O

Having O
almost O
unlimited O
wealth O
changes O
people O
, O
both O
those O
who O
are O
born O
into O
and O
earn O
their O
own O
money O
early O
on O
. O

But O
do O
they O
have O
the O
right O
to O
live O
this O
way O
? O

What O
about O
people O
who O
work O
very O
hard O
yet O
they O
seem O
to O
be O
paid O
miserably O
. O

A O
migrant O
work O
may O
slave O
away O
in O
a O
field O
all O
day O
long O
and O
make O
less O
money O
than O
wealthy O
person O
spends O
on O
tip O
at O
lunch O
. O

The O
answer O
this B-INCORRECT
question O
lies O
in O
one O
's O
feelings O
about O
Democracry B-INCORRECT
. O

Some O
would O
argue O
that O
if O
a O
person O
is O
smart O
enough O
or O
lucky O
to O
earn O
money O
for O
an O
early O
retirement O
( O
their O
children O
's O
inheritance O
) O
he B-INCORRECT
she O
entitled O
it O
. O

A O
rather O
hard O
view O
would O
be O
that O
if O
someone O
who O
works O
on O
a O
menial O
or O
physically O
taxing O
job O
does O
not O
make O
fair O
moderate O
salary O
then B-INCORRECT
it O
is O
his O
her O
own O
fault O
( O
bad O
luck O
) O
. O

These O
opinions O
are O
based O
on O
a O
rather O
faulty O
American O
premise O
that O
all O
people O
given O
an O
equal O
chance O
in O
life O
and O
what O
they O
make O
of O
it O
is O
their O
own O
responsibly B-INCORRECT
. O

Apparently O
, O
most O
people O
believe O
that O
they O
are O
underpaid O
and O
others O
overpaid O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
everyone O
seems O
to O
think O
that O
doctors O
make O
much B-INCORRECT
too B-INCORRECT
money O
for O
the O
work O
they O
do O
yet O
none O
of O
are O
lowering O
their O
fees O
( O
must O
it O
's O
a O
fair O
price O
) O
. O

So O
, O
unless O
we O
wish O
to O
impose O
on O
the O
personal O
lives O
of O
wealthy O
people O
by O
making O
them O
work O
harder O
or O
give O
who O
are O
not O
money O
that O
society O
does O
believe O
they O
deserve O
can O
pay O
equal O
contribution O
. O

I O
agree O
that O
in O
the O
past O
women O
have O
had O
problems O
with O
societies B-INCORRECT
role B-INCORRECT
of O
what O
they O
are O
expected O
to O
do O
work B-INCORRECT
place B-INCORRECT
and O
at O
home O
. O

Women O
have O
been O
looked O
down O
on O
if O
they O
try O
to O
get O
ahead O
and O
pay O
has O
differed O
with B-INCORRECT
the B-INCORRECT
same B-INCORRECT
job B-INCORRECT
for O
a O
man O
verses B-INCORRECT
woman O
doing O
. O

Gone O
is B-INCORRECT
the O
age O
that B-INCORRECT
woman O
required O
to O
stay O
home O
. O

Now O
a O
lot O
of O
women O
work O
and O
the O
ones O
that O
want O
to O
stay O
home O
do O
it O
because O
they O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
what O
has O
changed O
women O
's O
roles O
is O
the O
feminists B-INCORRECT
. O

These O
are O
groups O
of O
people O
that O
have O
defended O
women O
over O
the O
years O
. O

These O
people O
have O
shown O
the O
modern O
world O
what O
women O
in O
work B-INCORRECT
place B-INCORRECT
can O
do O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
that O
these O
feminists O
have O
not O
looked O
at O
all O
women O
. O

Some O
women O
were O
happy O
with O
old O
traditions O
, O
some O
wanted O
a O
bit O
more O
in O
their O
lives O
lot O
. O

What O
happens O
is O
that O
all O
women O
have O
to O
go O
along O
with O
these O
feminists O
rules O
. O

This O
makes O
it O
hard O
, O
because O
if O
they O
do O
n't O
are O
looked O
down O
upon O
by O
their O
piers B-INCORRECT
. O

An O
example O
is O
military O
women O
wanting O
to O
serve O
in O
combat O
positions O
when O
at O
war O
. O

Feminists O
argued O
this O
a O
lot O
when O
the O
Iraq O
war O
was O
going O
on O
. O

They O
felt O
that O
women O
should O
have O
been O
given O
the O
chance O
to O
fight O
. O

I O
felt O
that O
these O
people O
were O
crazy O
. O

Women O
just O
ca O
n't O
fight O
in O
a O
war O
very O
well O
. O

The B-INCORRECT
are O
not O
strong O
enough O
and O
if O
captured O
could O
be O
raped O
. O

They O
feel O
that O
it O
is O
not O
fair O
men O
are O
the O
only O
ones O
. O

Other O
women O
, O
though O
are O
glad O
that O
the O
rule O
in O
United O
States O
stands O
as O
it O
does O
. O

Feminists O
have O
talked O
about O
promotions O
in O
the O
work B-INCORRECT
place B-INCORRECT
as O
not O
being O
fair O
. O

Also O
sexual O
harassment O
is O
involved O
in O
a O
lot O
of O
suits O
. O

Many O
women O
believe O
that O
they O
are O
the O
victims O
. O

I O
agree O
that O
five O
to O
ten O
years O
ago O
this O
might O
have O
been O
true O
, O
but O
now O
many O
employers O
are O
the O
victims O
. O

They O
are O
scared O
of O
what O
a O
woman O
can O
do O
and O
sometimes O
women O
get O
looked O
at O
differently O
. O

There O
are O
some O
things O
that O
women O
can O
do O
better O
than O
men O
and O
there O
. O

God O
would O
have O
created O
us O
all O
the O
same O
if O
this O
was O
not O
true O
. O

Feminists O
are O
trying O
to O
make O
everyone O
equal O
and O
that O
is O
impossible O
do O
because O
nature O
can O
not O
be O
changed O
. O

More O
and O
more O
office O
jobs O
are O
being O
filled O
by O
the B-INCORRECT
woman B-INCORRECT
but O
a O
lot O
of O
physical O
still O
men O
. O

I O
think O
that O
the O
traditional O
roles O
were O
a O
good O
thing O
, O
but O
modernization O
has O
changed O
everyone O
's O
habits O
. O

Divorce O
is O
at O
fifty O
percent O
and O
rising O
, O
women O
are O
having O
more O
heart O
attacks O
being O
stressful B-INCORRECT
kids O
neglected O
. O

Modernization O
is O
good O
, O
but O
I O
think O
that O
women O
should O
not O
be O
pressured O
into O
this O
if O
for O
them O
. O

There O
will O
be O
a O
woman O
in O
the O
presidency O
, O
and O
running B-INCORRECT
lot O
more O
companies O
. O

Women O
should O
be O
created O
equal O
, O
but O
they B-INCORRECT
can O
only O
do O
what O
nature O
intended O
to O
... O

Whenever O
a O
movement O
is O
began B-INCORRECT
whether O
it O
be O
political O
, O
religious O
or O
artistic O
stereotypes O
are O
quick O
to O
form O
. O

People O
normally O
associated O
with O
politics O
, O
religion O
or O
art O
are O
quickly O
lumped O
into O
categories O
regardless O
of O
individual O
differences O
. O

This O
tragedy O
is O
worsened O
by O
the O
tendency O
of O
those O
outside O
movement O
to O
remember O
radical O
and O
ignore O
common O
or O
ordinary O
. O

This O
is O
especially O
true O
of O
the O
Women O
's O
Liberation O
Movement O
in O
America O
. O

Since O
its O
beginnings O
in O
the O
late O
nineteenth O
century O
, O
Women O
's O
Liberation O
has O
been O
met O
with O
adamant O
and O
often O
obstinate O
oppostion B-INCORRECT
. O

Some O
of O
the O
first O
radicals O
, O
Susan O
B. O
Anthony O
and O
George O
Sand O
( O
although O
French O
) O
were O
noticed O
ridiculed O
thus O
defeating O
their O
cause O
because O
aggressive O
action O
. O

At O
the O
same O
time O
other B-INCORRECT
feminists O
such O
as O
Emily O
Dickinson O
were O
virtually O
ignored O
during O
their O
lifetime O
and O
only O
acknowledged O
posthumously O
being O
part O
of O
movement O
. O

This O
ignorance O
of O
other O
less O
aggressive O
feminists O
, O
made O
it O
seem O
as O
though O
the O
feminist O
movement O
was O
headed O
only O
by O
wild O
disgruntled O
zealots O
and O
therfore B-INCORRECT
detrimental O
to O
good O
society O
. O

Although O
" O
radicals O
such O
as O
Sand O
and O
Anthony O
seem O
docile O
backward O
in B-INCORRECT
modern O
standards O
, O
the O
problem O
still O
exists O
. O

From O
the B-INCORRECT
very O
beginning O
Women O
's O
Movement O
in O
America O
has O
been O
fighting O
a O
losing O
battle O
. O

However O
, O
I O
contend O
that O
the O
fault O
does O
not O
lie O
with O
radical O
members O
of O
movement O
but O
rather O
in O
perception O
those O
observing O
. O

When O
Women O
's O
Lib O
really O
took O
off O
again O
in O
the O
late O
1960s O
, O
it O
was O
destined O
for O
failure O
. O

Immediately O
, O
the O
focus O
was O
on O
radicals O
like O
Stein O
instead O
of O
housewife O
who O
returned O
to O
college O
and O
made O
a O
career O
for O
herself O
. O

Those O
outside O
the O
movement O
could O
only O
see O
differences O
between O
" O
normality O
and O
Women O
's O
Lib O
. O

This O
is O
still O
true O
twenty O
- O
five O
years O
later O
. O

Women O
supporting O
equal O
pay O
for O
women O
and B-INCORRECT
other O
" O
liberal O
causes O
like O
affirmative O
action O
are O
only O
seen O
in O
the O
shadow O
of O
bra O
- O
burning O
, O
anti O
shaving O
leaders O
1970s O
. O

The O
good O
of O
their O
cause O
is O
undermined O
by O
the O
perception O
radicals O
. O

So O
what O
am O
I O
getting O
at O
? O

Only O
that O
so O
- O
called O
feminists O
have O
not O
in O
and O
of O
themselves O
harmed O
the O
Women O
's O
movement O
. O

However O
, O
the O
popular O
perception O
of O
them O
has O
. O

For O
so O
many O
years O
the B-INCORRECT
good O
that O
feminists O
have O
promote B-INCORRECT
for O
women O
has O
fallen O
by O
wayside O
in O
lieu O
of O
other O
more O
interesting O
, O
i.e. O
radical O
ideas B-INCORRECT
. O

Like O
many O
other O
aspects O
and O
movements O
in O
life O
, O
they O
would O
be O
more O
readiliy B-INCORRECT
received O
if O
the O
public O
it O
was B-INCORRECT
being O
aimed O
not O
so O
jaded O
. O

Within B-INCORRECT
this O
century O
there O
have O
been O
many O
technological O
advances O
which O
resulted O
in O
a O
drastically O
different O
society O
than O
that O
of O
hundred O
years O
ago O
. O

Clearly O
, O
of O
the O
inventions O
this O
century O
one O
that O
has O
made O
most O
impact O
on O
world O
views O
and O
lifestyle O
is O
television O
. O

This O
instrument O
has O
brought O
other O
worlds O
right O
into O
the O
living O
room O
, O
making O
it O
possible O
to O
see O
life O
in O
countries O
a O
way O
that O
was O
never O
before O
. O

However O
, O
the O
invention O
of O
television O
also O
gave O
society O
an O
easy O
way O
to O
waste O
time O
; O
one O
has O
only O
turn O
it O
on O
tune O
out O
reality O
. O

Television O
has O
potential B-INCORRECT
to O
offer O
wonderful O
things O
its O
viewers O
, O
such O
as O
educational O
programming O
for O
children O
cultural O
programs O
about O
far O
away O
places O
and O
a O
closer O
look O
at O
current O
events O
than O
can O
not B-INCORRECT
be O
given O
by O
newspaper B-INCORRECT
. O

Television O
has O
the O
power O
to O
bring O
war O
into O
home O
as O
well O
artistic O
expressions O
of O
those O
involved O
in O
program O
production O
, O
giving O
society O
opportunity O
understand O
their O
own O
culture O
more O
fully O
. O

However O
, O
this O
is O
not O
the O
way O
in O
which O
television O
has O
influenced O
society O
. O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
television O
has O
become O
escape O
route O
of O
masses O
a O
way O
for O
people O
to O
flee O
from O
conflicts O
they O
experience O
in O
their O
culture O
rather O
than O
confront O
them O
and O
try O
understand O
. O

In O
the O
minds O
of O
most O
Americans O
, O
television O
is O
regarded O
as O
a O
diversion O
rather O
than O
an O
educational O
tool O
free O
entertainment O
instead O
easily O
accessible O
knowledge O
. O

Millions O
of O
Americans O
can O
be O
found O
to O
staring O
at O
the O
T.V. B-INCORRECT
any O
one O
time O
, O
watching O
sit O
- O
coms O
soap O
operas O
and O
cartoons O
. O

The O
T.V. B-INCORRECT
has O
become O
the O
center O
of O
many O
households O
; O
in O
families O
, O
only O
time O
that O
everyone O
is O
together O
when O
they O
are O
watching O
television O
. O

T.V. B-INCORRECT
is O
a O
major O
cause O
of O
lack O
togetherness O
found O
in O
many O
American O
families O
, O
and O
has O
also O
resulted O
an O
increase O
laziness O
. O

The O
more O
time O
one O
spends O
watching O
TV O
, O
the O
less O
motivated O
he B-INCORRECT
becomes O
; O
there O
is O
no O
need O
to O
seek O
worthwhile O
activities O
when O
it O
much O
easier O
sit O
on O
couch O
pick O
up O
remote O
control O
and O
stare O
at O
a O
box O
. O

Television O
, O
therefore O
has O
changed O
society O
in O
ways O
that O
could O
hardly O
have O
been O
dreamed O
of O
00 O
years O
ago O
. O

It O
has O
given O
society O
another O
creative O
vein O
, O
a O
look O
at O
worlds O
which O
could O
be O
seen O
in O
no O
other O
way O
and O
an O
opportunity O
to O
better O
educate O
itself O
. O

However O
, O
throughout O
the O
years O
television O
has O
lost O
much O
of O
its O
integrety B-INCORRECT
; O
programs O
offered O
are O
usually O
cheap O
entertainment O
rather O
than O
education O
. O

The O
entertainment O
aspect O
of O
television O
has O
offered O
society O
an O
easy O
escape O
from O
its O
problems O
and O
dificulties B-INCORRECT
. O

Therefore O
, O
since O
the O
invention O
of O
television O
society O
has O
becomed B-INCORRECT
more O
informed O
but O
too O
lazy O
to O
think O
about O
this O
new O
information O
and O
distanced O
itself O
from O
family O
life O
. O

A O
discovery O
that O
has O
significantly O
changed O
many O
peoples O
lives O
and O
their O
ways O
of O
thinking O
is O
the O
epidemic O
, B-INCORRECT
known O
as O
AIDS O
. O

Though O
it O
has O
probably O
been O
around O
for O
awhile B-INCORRECT
, O
's B-INCORRECT
presence O
hasn't O
really O
known O
untill B-INCORRECT
fairly O
recently O
and O
consequences O
have O
devistating B-INCORRECT
. O

AIDS O
has O
definately B-INCORRECT
had O
an O
impact O
on O
people O
in O
the O
United O
States O
and O
probably O
all O
over O
world O
because B-INCORRECT
it O
always O
leads O
to O
death O
there O
is O
no O
cure O
. O

It O
has O
caused O
a O
lot O
of O
prejudice O
and O
paranoia O
among O
people O
which O
torn O
them O
apart O
. O

For O
example O
, O
there O
is O
more O
of B-INCORRECT
stigma O
attached O
to O
being O
a O
homosexual O
male O
not O
only O
because O
their O
sexual O
preference O
but O
they O
probably O
have O
AIDS O
too B-INCORRECT
. O

This O
kind O
of O
ignorant O
thinking O
is O
breaking O
us O
apart O
. O

Also O
, O
when O
Ryan O
White O
a O
boy O
who O
contracted O
AIDS O
through O
blood O
transfusion O
was O
diagnosed O
the O
people O
of O
his O
town O
and O
school O
treated O
him O
like O
complete O
outcast O
would O
n't O
allow O
to O
attend O
. O

With O
new O
discoveries O
of O
AIDS O
, O
paranoia O
is O
at O
an O
all O
time B-INCORRECT
high O
. O

Doctors O
are O
discovering O
that O
some O
undetectable O
strands B-INCORRECT
of O
AIDS O
do O
exist O
. O

This O
has O
really O
scared O
people O
because O
they O
may O
have O
AIDS O
and O
not O
even O
know O
it O
. O

I O
feel O
this O
has O
really O
made O
people O
think O
about O
their O
actions O
. O

In O
the O
early O
eighties O
" B-INCORRECT
casual O
sex O
in O
United O
States O
was O
a O
widely O
accepted O
idea O
, O
now O
it O
is O
something O
people O
really O
take O
into O
consideration O
and O
rarely B-INCORRECT
occurs O
. O

Relationships O
seemed B-INCORRECT
to O
be O
valued O
more O
than O
one O
night B-INCORRECT
stands O
. O

People O
are O
starting O
to O
realize O
that O
they O
really O
do O
have O
be O
careful O
, O
and O
with O
more O
education O
on O
this O
disease O
I O
'm O
sure O
changes O
will O
come O
about O
. O

The O
twentieth O
century O
has O
seen O
more O
wars O
than O
any O
other O
previous O
bloc O
of O
time O
. O

Though B-INCORRECT
advances O
in O
communication O
, O
transportation O
and O
information O
sharing O
the O
world O
as O
a O
body O
of O
people O
living O
close O
proximity O
has O
rapidly O
shrunk O
. O

In O
the O
second O
of O
world O
wars O
, O
race O
was O
on O
to O
create O
most O
devastating O
powerful O
and O
frightening O
weapon O
our O
people O
had O
ever O
known O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
the O
discovery O
and O
harness B-INCORRECT
of O
atom B-INCORRECT
its O
energy O
corresponding O
invention O
nuclear O
weapons O
have O
been O
most O
significant O
factors O
change O
in O
our O
lifetime O
if O
not O
perhaps O
several O
lifetimes O
. O

As O
missile O
technology O
and O
nuclear O
fusion O
capacities O
increased O
improved O
, O
fear O
began O
to O
replace O
nationalism O
our O
small O
world O
erected O
barriers O
between O
its O
members O
. O

From O
my O
experience O
as O
an O
American O
, O
I O
can O
remember O
associating O
communism O
with O
nuclear O
threat O
Soviet O
citizens O
anti B-INCORRECT
- O
Christ O
and O
bomb O
shelters O
secret O
cities O
for B-INCORRECT
underground O
weapons O
orbiting O
our O
planet O
daily O
normal O
life O
. O

Perhaps O
this O
increasingly O
common O
mentality O
is O
the O
worst O
effect O
of O
our O
nuclear O
, O
cold O
war O
age O
. O

In O
a O
planet O
which O
desperately O
needs O
our O
focus O
on O
environmental O
and O
humanitarian O
issues O
, O
my O
country O
has O
spent O
uncountable O
trillions O
of O
dollars O
nuclear O
weapons O
testing O
improvement O
implementation O
. O

As O
a O
commonplace O
goal O
and O
testimonial O
landmark O
to O
9 O
presidential O
administrations O
, O
the O
cold O
war O
has O
manifested O
its O
awesome O
power O
control O
over O
nearly O
every O
facet O
of O
Americana O
; O

In O
just O
the O
past O
three O
years O
our B-INCORRECT
family O
of O
nations O
has O
seen O
dismantling O
Berlin O
Wall O
and O
hundreds O
other O
smaller O
symbols O
freedom O
, O
an O
end O
to O
oppression O
in O
many O
circumstances O
. O

With O
this O
, O
the O
walls O
barbed O
wire O
and O
mental O
barriers O
are O
falling O
bringing O
more O
change O
than O
our O
planet O
has O
seen O
since O
its O
genesis O
. O

Although O
the B-INCORRECT
old O
habits O
die O
hard O
, O
they O
are O
indeed O
dying O
. O

In O
America O
the B-INCORRECT
military O
has O
been O
reduced O
by O
several O
thousand O
troops O
, O
and O
production O
of O
nuclear O
warheads O
virtually O
arrived O
a B-INCORRECT
standstill O
. O

Hopefully O
, O
with O
continued O
efforts O
our O
use O
of O
nuclear O
fusion O
and O

will O
turn O
from O
mediums O

to O

With O
this O
thawing O
of O

, O
our O
frigid O
planet O
and O
cold O

may O
once O
again O
be O

The O
discovery O
of O
penicillin O
as O
an O
antibiotic O
was O
one O
the O
greatest O
advances O
in O
medicinal B-INCORRECT
chemistry O
. O

As O
a O
natural O
antibiotic O
, O
penicillin O
was O
discovered O
to O
have O
many O
uses O
in O
stopping O
and O
preventing O
the O
spread O
of O
infections O
. O

This O
" O
wonder O
- O
drug O
also O
led O
to O
the O
discovery O
of O
a O
variety O
other O
naturally O
occurring O
antibiotics O
that O
could O
be O
cultured O
in O

laboratory O
. O

This O
sudden O
burst O
of O
useful O
compounds O
not O
only O
improved O
the O
chances O
a O
patient O
's O
survival O
in O
hospital O
but B-INCORRECT
also O
caused O
great O
need O
for O
medical O
chemists O
to O
study O
and O
classify O
each O
new O
drug O
as O
it O
was O
discovered O
. O

As O
discoveries O
of O
new O
antibiotics O
decreased O
, O
chemists O
began O
to O
wonder O
if O
certain O
variations O
these O
drugs O
could O
be O
synthesized O
and O
also O
used O
as O
medicine O
. O

It O
was O
also O
attemped B-INCORRECT
to O
increase O
the O
production O
of O
naturally O
- O
occurring O
antibiotics O
through O
synthesis O
. O

Both O
of O
these O
new O
attempts O
caused O
a O
need O
for O
more O
research O
, O
companies O
and O
medical O
chemists O
the O
industry O
increased O
tremendously O
. O

It O
was O
discovered O
that O
the O
older O
drugs O
could O
be O
synthesized O
efficiently O
while O
still O
remaining O
biologically O
active O
. O

New O
drugs O
were O
also O
synthesized O
; O
some O
found O
to O
be O
medically O
useful O
while O
others O
not O
. O

A O
variety O
of O
new O
drugs O
continuously O
appeared O
on O
the O
market O
and O
changed O
way O
people O
thought O
about O
taking O
medicine O
. O

It O
was O
now O
much O
easier O
to O
obtain O
antibiotics O
for O
simple O
illnesses O
, O
such O
as O
the O
common O
cold O
. O

Huge O
enterprises O
, O
such O
as O
Upjohn O
were O
formed O
and O
grew O
universities O
had O
research O
teams O
devoted O
to O
producing O
efficient O
synthesis O
routes O
for O
the O
production O
of O
all O
kinds O
antibiotics O
. O

The O
discovery O
of O

led O
to O

advances O
and O
also O
a O
tremendous O
impact O
on O
society O
. O

The O
computer O
has O
eliminated O
many O
jobs O
through O
automation O
of O
factories O
; B-INCORRECT
accounting O
, O
engineering O
and O
other O
scientific O
programs O
etc O
. O

The O
effects O
of O
the O
computer O
have O
been O
tremendous O
; B-INCORRECT
however B-INCORRECT
, O
phenomenon O
is O
a O
catch-22 O
. O

The O
computer O
has O
made O
life O
easier O
from O
a O
physical O
standpoint O
and O
harder O
mental O
. O

The O
physical O
effects O
of O
the O
computer O
are O
numerous O
and O
easily O
seen O
. O

In O
offices O
, O
the O
computer O
is O
everywhere O
. O

From O
word O
processors O
to O
spreadsheet O
/ O
database O
programs O
, O
computers O
have O
made O
office O
work O
easier O
and O
faster O
. O

Automation O
of O
factories O
has O
also O
eliminated O
many O
manual O
jobs O
. O

Also O
almost B-INCORRECT
everyone O
has O
at O
least O
one O
simple O
computer O
, O
e.g. O
a O
calculator O
. O

There O
are O
of B-INCORRECT
course O
many B-INCORRECT
other O
things O
computers O
used O
for O
, O
but O
a O
lengthy O
list O
is O
not O
necessary O
as O
everyone O
already O
knows O
( O
except O
people O
in O
2nd B-INCORRECT
and O
3rd O
world B-INCORRECT
countries O
) O
how O
abundant B-INCORRECT
. O

The O
mental O
effect O
of O
computers O
is O
two O
- O
fold O
. O

Firstly O
, O
computers O
have O
made O
mathematical O
computations O
so O
easy O
to O
do O
many O
people O
not O
fully O
understand O
how O
or O
why O
their O
computer O
works O
. O

This O
has O
created O
a O
surplus O
of O
" O
needless O
computations O
, O
figures O
etc O
. O

People O
can O
easily O
do O
calculus O
or O
other O
type B-INCORRECT
functions O
with O
a O
computer O
. O

What O
many O
people O
do O
not O
realize O
is O
that O
computers O
make O
errors O
all O
the O
time O
. O

Granted O
, O
it O
is O
the O
person O
who O
" O
told O
computer O
what O
to O
do O
that O
truly O
made O
error O
; B-INCORRECT
however B-INCORRECT
if O
knew O
he O
should O
or O
better O
stated O
was O
able O
with O
a O
would O
not O
have O
erroneous O
answers O
. O

Mathematical O
models O
, O
theories O
etc O
. O

are O
absolutely O
riddled O
with O
errors O
simply O
because O
there O
many O
things O
people O
do O
n't O
know O
or O
ca O
predict O
. O

Due O
to O
this O
errors B-INCORRECT
frequently O
exist O
in O
the O
world O
of O
computers O
simply O
because O
humans O
are O
ignorant- B-INCORRECT
for O
whatever O
reason O
- O
many O
" O
variables O
. O

Secondly O
, O
computers O
have O
sometimes O
become O
more O
reliable O
than O
people O
. O

A O
computer O
's O
circuits O
do O
n't O
get O
tired O
and O
, O
if O
programmed O
100% O
correctly O
( O
another O
perhaps O
impossible O
computation O
) O
never O
make O
errors O
. O

This O
supposed O
reliability O
has O
left O
many O
workers O
out O
of O
work O
. O

The O
effects O
of O
this O
are O
unpredictable O
. O

Anger O
, O
frustration O
fear O
and O
many O
other O
negative O
feelings O
have O
sprung O
up O
simultaneously O
with O
the O
rise O
of O
computer O
usage O
. O

Clearly O
, O
there O
is O
evidence O
of O
good O
and O
bad O
results O
from O
the O
advent O
modern O
computer O
. O

It O
would O
be O
practically O
impossible O
to O
throw O
the O
computer O
away O
or O
never O
use O
it O
again O
. O

Yet O
there O
are O
practical O
solutions O
. O

Better O
mathematical O
education O
is O
needed O
for O
everyone O
who O
uses O
a O
computer O
other O
than O
simple O
calculator O
. O

Also O
, O
curtailing O
some O
theoretical O
programming O
could O
eliminate O
alarming O
predictions O
or O
erroneous O
results O
. O

The O
key O
is O
probably O
in O
the O
classroom O
. O

People O
should O
learn O
more O
about B-INCORRECT
the O
ramifications O
what O
they O
are O
doing O
. O

( O
This O
probably O
would O
require O
understanding B-INCORRECT
of O
philosophy O
and O
psychology O
as O
well O
mathematics O
science O
. O
) O

In O
either O
case O
, O
if B-INCORRECT
computers O
are O
good O
or O
bad O
it O
would O
be O
difficult O
to O
dispute O
their O
impact O
on O
people O
's O
lives O
. O

The O
creation O
of O

, B-INCORRECT
has O
dramatically O
changed O
the O
entertainment O
business O
. O

The O

distinct O
advantages O
for O

And O

The O
creation O
of O
the B-INCORRECT

in O
past O
20 O
years O
, B-INCORRECT
has O
altered O
average O

for O
better O
and O
sometimes O

It O
has O
created O
an O
information O
age O
, O
which O
could O
be O
dangerous O
and O
heightened B-INCORRECT

. O

The O
pro O
's B-INCORRECT
and O
con O
of O
the O
satellite O

are O
numerous O
. O

The O
only O
observation O
which O
can O
be O
made O
, O
is O
that B-INCORRECT
: O
It B-INCORRECT
has O
altered O
people O
lives B-INCORRECT
significantly O
. O

It O
is O
up O
to O
the B-INCORRECT
average O
person O
decide O
if O
this O
alteration O
will O
be O
for O
better O
or O
worse O
. O

The O
discovery O
of O
the B-INCORRECT
Atomic B-INCORRECT
energy O
, B-INCORRECT
is O
undoubtedly O
most O
awesome O
as O
well O
terrible B-INCORRECT
invention O
not O
only O
20th O
century O
but O
all O
time O
. O

In O
1945 O
, O
J. O
Robert O
Oppenheimer O
unveiled O
to O
the O
world O
his O
invention O
in O
form O
that O
is O
still O
most O
familiar O
us O
today O
: O
The O
Atomic B-INCORRECT
bomb O
. O

The O
reason O
behind O
the O
fear O
that O
this O
energy O
causes O
is O
routed O
in O
its O
incredible O
power O
to O
destroy O
. O

Never O
before O
had O
the O
world O
seen O
something O
with O
such O
a O
capacity O
to O
kill O
. O

Never O
before O
had O
one O
object O
of O
such O
small O
size O
been O
able O
to O
take O
so O
many O
lives O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
, O
It O
is O
considered O
the O
most O
awe O
- O
inspiring O
and O
dangerous O
weapon O
in O
world O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
with O
each O
progressive B-INCORRECT
day O
the O
world O
's O
need O
for O
this O
dangerous O
energy O
augments B-INCORRECT
. O

For O
not O
only O
does O
it O
have O
the O
capacity O
to O
kill O
, O

but O
also O
the O
capability O
to O
supply O
and O
energize O
world O
. O

The O
drawback O
is O
the O
danger O
. O

In O
utilizing O
this O
power O
in O
plants O
and O
factories O
we O
run O
the O
risk O
of O
contaminating O
our O
land O
, O
blowing O
holes O
sky B-INCORRECT
rendering O
seas O
useless O
killing O
species O
as O
well O
all O
earth O
. O

Although O
we O
have O
many O
other O
power O
source O
alternatives O
, O
still O
continue O
to O
use O
this O
dangerous O
invention O
. O

It O
is O
illogical O
to O
think O
that O
with O
continued O
nuclear O
use O
, O
we O
can O
escape O
harm O
. O

Already O
as O
a O
result O
of O
pollution O
and O
other O
various O
factors O
, O
we O
have O
holes O
in O
our O
ozone O
layer O
problems O
with O
soil O
many O
parts O
the O
world O
. O

It O
would O
be O
logical O
to O
think O
that O
the O
leaders O
of O
world O
confer O
and O
aspire O
put O
a O
stop O
nuclear O
use O
in O
an O
effort O
avoid O
any O
further O
damage O
earth O
its O
inhabitants O
. O

The O
saddest O
part O
of O
this O
tragedy O
is O
that O
there O
have O
been O
very O
few O
efforts O
to O
do O
so O
. O

The O
lack O
of O
sight B-INCORRECT
from O
our O
leaders O
is O
almost O
appalling O
. O

With O
the O
lack O
of O
respect O
for O
planet O
that O
is O
general O
attitude O
today O
, O
what O
to O
become O
our O
children O
. B-INCORRECT

The O
current O
situation O
of O
the O
world O
's O
environment O
is O
a O
sad O
one O
. O

It O
is O
also O
however B-INCORRECT
, O
a O
problem O
of O
which O
nuclear O
energy O
only O
small O
piece O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
day O
will O
soon O
come O
when O
damage O
caused O
by O
this O
apathy O
be O
irreversable B-INCORRECT
. O

This O
is O
why O
it O
imperative O
to O
act O
today O
. O

It O
starts O
with O
you O
. O

Write O
your O
local O

An O
invention O
of O
the O
20th O
century O
which O
I O
think O
has O
significantly O
changed O
people O
's O
lives O
is O
airplane O
. O

The O
extend B-INCORRECT
to O
which O
this O
invention O
has O
altered O
people O
's O
lives O
is O
astronomical O
. O

The O
airplane O
opened O
doors O
to O
traveling O
and O
also O
broadened O
people O
's O
perceptions O
of O
the O
entire O
world O
. O

It O
also O
introduced O
what O
seemed O
a O
completely O
impossible O
concept O
which O
no O
human O
is O
capable O
of O
doing O
without O
machine O
: O
the O
flying O
. O

Before O
the O
invention O
of O
airplane O
, O
long O
distance B-INCORRECT
traveling B-INCORRECT
was O
a O
very O
difficult O
time O
consuming B-INCORRECT
task O
. O

For O
this O
reason O
people B-INCORRECT
did O
not O
travel O
extremely O
long O
distances O
and O
missed O
the O
opportunity O
of O
visiting O
countries O
with O
cultures O
very O
different O
from O
their O
own O
. O

One O
could O
travel O
by O
boat O
but O
this O
was O
inconvenient O
and O
often O
dangerous O
because O
of O
various O
things O
like O
disease O
, O
hunger O
threatening O
weather O
; B-INCORRECT
also B-INCORRECT
as O
noted O
above O
it O
extremely O
time O
consuming B-INCORRECT
. O

Because O
of O
the O
lack O
long O
distance B-INCORRECT
travel O
people B-INCORRECT
often O
had O
a O
very O
ethnocentric O
and O
limited O
concept O
world O
. O

I O
have O
learned O
a O
lot O
about O
my O
own O
culture O
just O
from O
being O
in O
Spain O
and O
that O
is O
the O
only O
foreign O
country O
ever O
visited O
. O

I O
can O
admit O
that O
before O
came O
to O
Spain O
was O
very O
ignorant O
about O
other O
cultures O
. O

Even O
though O
I O
would O
watch O
the O
news O
and O
read O
about O
other O
cultures O
still O
did O
not O
have O
opportunity O
to O
witness O
it O
first O
hand O
. O

The O
invention O
of O
the O
airplane O
has O
opened O
many O
doors O
and O
one O
other O
door O
is O
international O
relations O
. O

Since O
the B-INCORRECT
invention O
of O
airplane O
world O
has O
increased O
close O
contact O
between O
political O
systems O
, O
and O
international O
business O
endeavors O
. O

The O
frequency O
that B-INCORRECT
which O
foreign O
countries O
are O
able O
to O
communicate O
and O
negotiate O
face O
has O
improved O
drastically O
the O
establishment O
of O
international O
trade O
. O

The O
airplane O
has O
also B-INCORRECT
basically O
speeded O
up O
the O
whole O
postal O
communication O
system O
. O

Life O
with O
airplanes O
is O
more O
rapid O
paced O
. O

Cars O
, O
telephones O
and O
nuclear O
energy O
are O
just O
three O
examples O
of O
inventions O
discoveries O
that O
have O
had O
profound O
effects O
on O
modern O
day B-INCORRECT
life O
. O

We O
must O
remember O
, O
however O
that O
the O
field O
of O
technology O
is O
not O
only O
one O
in O
which O
significant O
advances O
have O
been O
made O
0th B-INCORRECT
century O
. O

Another O
" O
discovery O
of O
this O
past O
century O
has O
been O
feminism O
, O
which O
had O
a O
significant O
impact O
on O
the O
lives O
both O
men O
and O
women O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
the O
issue O
of O
feminism O
is O
not O
a O
new O
one O
but O
it O
just O
within O
past O
century O
that O
much B-INCORRECT
progress O
has O
been O
made O
towards O
equality O
women O
( O
with O
important O
exception O
winning O
right O
to O
vote O
in O
1800s O
) O
. O

As O
recently O
as O
the O
1950s O
, O
it O
was O
still O
most O
typical O
well O
ideal O
to O
have O
woman O
in O
home O
housekeeping O
and O
tending O
children O
. O

The O
first O
significant O
equal O
rights O
movement O
in O
the O
U.S. O
was O
70s O
with O
Equal O
Rights O
Amendment O
, O
which O
failed O
. O

Even O
today O
, O
the B-INCORRECT
woman O
is O
still O
only O
earning O
something O
like O
60 O
cents O
for O
every O
dollar O
that O
a O
man O
earns O
. O

Feminism O
does O
not O
only O
have O
to O
do O
with O
work O
and O
money O
, O
but O
also O
the O
image O
of O
women O
. O

It O
's O
only O
recently O
that O
we O
've O
" O
discovered O
, O
or O
begun O
to O
think O
about O
rather O
how O
much B-INCORRECT
things O
as O
varying B-INCORRECT
pornography O
the O
language O
use O
helps B-INCORRECT
form O
image O
of O
women O
. O

A O
recognition O
of O
such O
influences O
on O
the O
image O
women O
is O
first O
step O
in O
breaking O
it O
down O
, O
so O
that O
are O
seen O
for O
who O
they O
truly O
. O

Feminism O
is O
better O
described O
as O
a O
" O
discovery O
in O
progress O
; O
it O
's O
movement O
, O
an O
attitude O
that O
has O
not O
yet O
become O
mainstream O
. O

Only O
when O
women O
have O
achieved O
equality O
with O
men O
, O
will O
there O
cease O
to O
be O
a O
need O
for O
feminism O
and O
the O
discovery O
been O
completed O
. O

The O
idea O
I B-INCORRECT
feel B-INCORRECT
that B-INCORRECT
has O
most O
significantly O
changed O
people O
's O
lives O
in O
the O
20th O
century O
is O
of O
caring O
for O
environment O
. O

Today O
, O
people O
have O
become O
aware O
of O
the O
importance O
environment B-INCORRECT
to O
our O
future O
. O

People O
are O
concerned O
with B-INCORRECT
nuclear O
weapons O
. O

We O
realize O
that B-INCORRECT
countries O
which O
have O
many O
weapons O
the O
power O
to O
destroy O
world O
. O

Also O
related O
to O
this O
topic O
is O
nuclear O
waste O
. O

Nuclear O
waste O
is O
not O
only O
harmful O
to O
humans O
; B-INCORRECT
it O
also O
kills O
animals O
and O
plants O
. O

We O
are O
now O
fighting O
for O
acts O
to O
clean O
up O
our O
lakes O
and O
rivers O
. O

Companies O
are O
no O
longer O
able O
to O
freely O
dump O
their O
wastes B-INCORRECT
w B-INCORRECT
/ B-INCORRECT
o B-INCORRECT
being O
heavily O
fined O
. O

People O
have O
also O
become O
concerned O
with B-INCORRECT
nature O
. O

We O
used O
to O
assume O
our O
natural O
resources O
were O
never O
ending O
. O

Now O
, O
though O
we O
realize O
what O
use O
needs O
to O
be O
replaced O
. O

For O
example O
deforestation B-INCORRECT
is O
a O
very O
big O
issue O
, B-INCORRECT
many B-INCORRECT
groups O
have O
formed O
to O
plant O
more O
trees O
. O

We O
also O
realize O
our O
fossil O
fuels O
need O
to O
be O
used O
more O
conservatively O
. O

Another O
important O
topic O
we O
are O
all O
aware O
of O
is O
recycling O
. O

This O
links O
2 O
issues O
, O
one O
of O
not O
producing O
much B-INCORRECT
nonbiodegradable B-INCORRECT
products O
and O
the O
other O
reusing O
what O
we O
have O
. O

( O
Recycling O
in O
a O
small O
way O
also O
helps O
those O
w B-INCORRECT
/ B-INCORRECT
o B-INCORRECT
homes O
b B-INCORRECT
c B-INCORRECT
they O
receive O
money O
for O
their B-INCORRECT
collections B-INCORRECT
) O
. O

Many O
countries O
realize O
that O
recycling O
is O
not O
only O
beneficial O
to O
their O
economy O
it B-INCORRECT
also O
environment O
. O

Another O
important O
issue O
is O
that O
of O
conserving O
energy O
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
once O
again O
we O
assumed O
our O
energy O
was O
never O
ending O
. O

Now O
though O
people B-INCORRECT
are O
more O
inclined O
to O
turn O
off O
their O
lights O
when O
they O
're O
not O
in O
rooms O
, O
leave O
taps O
running O
and O
basically O
waste O
our O
natural O
resources O
. O

We O
realize O
that O
conserving O
is B-INCORRECT
not O
beneficial B-INCORRECT
to O
our O
environment O
but O
it O
also O
saves O
money O
. O

We O
have O
also O
become O
more O
considerable B-INCORRECT
of O
our O
animal O
life O
. O

We O
are O
no O
longer O
able O
to O
kill O
animals O
freely O
. O

We O
do O
still O
raise O
some O
for O
food O
but B-INCORRECT
hunting O
is O
limited O
and O
we O
are O
all O
aware O
of O
the O
possibilities O
extinction O
. O

One O
realizes O
that O
animals O
have O
rights O
too O
. O

In O
conclusion O
, O
the O
idea O
of O
caring O
for O
environment O
is O
still O
a O
new O
one O
. O

We O
are O
slowly O
becoming O
more O
aware O
and O
beginning O
to O
take O
precautions O
. O

The O
ideas O
above O
are O
just O
a O
few O
of O
the O
topics O
we O
now O
concerned O
with B-INCORRECT
. O

But O
we O
are O
heading O
in O
the O
right O
direction O
and O
hopeful B-INCORRECT
by O
21st O
century O
will O
have O
fixed O
everything O
destroyed O
! O

Computers O
have O
definitely O
effected B-INCORRECT
peoples O
lives O
. O

I O
have O
a O
computer O
and O
my O
life O
has O
change B-INCORRECT
because O
of O
it O
. O

I O
'm O
able O
to O
store O
almost O
all O
the O
information O
need O
for O
school O
and O
other O
things O
in O
my O
computer O
whereas B-INCORRECT
before O
had O
a O
desk O
was O
cluttered O
w/ B-INCORRECT
paper O
records O
of O
sorts O
, O
no O
longer O
keep O
these O
but O
only O
transfer O
them O
. O

This O
means O
I O
'm O
able O
to O
store O
more O
information O
in O
an O
organized O
fashion O
. O

Though O
I O
have O
only O
used O
a O
fraction O
of O
my O
computer O
's O
ability O
, O
'm O
still O
aware O
the O
tremendous O
opportunities O
which O
or O
will O
. O

Aside O
from O
being O
able O
to O
store O
great O
amounts O
of O
info B-INCORRECT
, O
I O
'm O
also O
process O
and O
edit O
things O
quickly O
. O

For O
example O
, O
without O
the O
use O
of O
a O
computer O
I O
had O
to O
balance O
my O
checkbook O
once O
month O
and O
this B-INCORRECT
w/ B-INCORRECT
calculator O
pen O
piece O
paper O
. O

Of O
course O
, O
this O
was O
very O
time O
consuming B-INCORRECT
and O
open O
to O
error O
. O
W/ B-INCORRECT
the O
use O
of O
a O
computer O
I B-INCORRECT
have O
programmed O
make O
calculations O
which O
once O
had O

Also O
, O
w/ B-INCORRECT
the O
use O
of O
Word O
Processor O
I B-INCORRECT
'm O
able O
to O
edit O
and O
rearrange O
documents O
w B-INCORRECT
/ B-INCORRECT
out B-INCORRECT
altering O
entire O
document O
furthermore O
though O
have O
yet O
Communications O
program O
in B-INCORRECT
my O
computer O
this O
seems O
be O
extraordinarily O
helpful O
. O

My O
father O
has O
the O
same O
program O
in B-INCORRECT
his O
computer O
and O
is O
able O
to O
buy O
on B-INCORRECT
line B-INCORRECT
tickets O
w B-INCORRECT
/ B-INCORRECT
out B-INCORRECT
leaving O
house O
moreover O
picking O
up O
phone O
. O

Also O
, O
I O
realize O
that O
my O
experience O
w/ B-INCORRECT
computers O
is O
limited O
and O
the O
power O
of O
for O
me O
incomprehensible O
. O

I O
'm O
now O
here O
in O
Madrid O
. O

How O
did O
I O
get O
there B-INCORRECT
? O

Well O
, O
I O
applied O
to O
the B-INCORRECT
this O
program O
was O
accepted O
and O
flew O
here O
form B-INCORRECT
US O
. O

But O
, O
w B-INCORRECT
/ B-INCORRECT
out B-INCORRECT
the O
use O
of O
computers O
I B-INCORRECT
would O
still O
be O
struggling O
w/ B-INCORRECT
secretary O
in O
International O
Programs O
Office O
at O
Boston O
University O
no O
doubt O
. O

Instead O
, O
once O
I O
applied O
to O
the O
program- B-INCORRECT
application O
for O
which O
was O
probably O
computer O
generated- B-INCORRECT
assume O
my O
info O
processed O
by O
a O
. O

W B-INCORRECT
/ B-INCORRECT
out B-INCORRECT
this O
luxury O
, O
the O
International O
Programs O
Office O
would O
inevitably O
inundated B-INCORRECT
w/ B-INCORRECT
paperwork O
and O
things O
therefore O
be O
lost O
or O
at O
least O
misplaced O
. O

When O
booking O
my O
flight O
, O
though O
I O
did O
not O
do O
this O
myself O
the O
transaction O
would O
seem O
impossible O
minus B-INCORRECT
aid O
of O
computers O
. O

Computers O
have O
had O
a O
most O
significant O
impact O
on O
the B-INCORRECT
people O
in O
latter O
1/2 O
of O
20th O
century O
. O

An O
invention O
of O
the O
20th O
century O
that O
I O
think O
has O
significantly O
changed O
people O
's O
lives O
is O
television O
. O

TV O
allows O
the O
instantaneous O
communication O
of O
ideas O
, O
images O
news O
etc O
. O

Now O
, O
if O
something O
is O
happening O
in O
any O
part O
of O
the O
world- B-INCORRECT
from O
across O
town O
all B-INCORRECT
way O
to O
Beijing O
-- B-INCORRECT
every O
person O
world O
can O
watch O
this O
event O
as O
it O
. O

While O
previously B-INCORRECT
people B-INCORRECT
had O
to O
wait O
days O
, B-INCORRECT
or O
even O
weeks O
for O
news O
( O
which O
consisted O
of O
second O
- O
third O
hand O
accounts O
always O
involved O
much O
interpretation O
and O
distortion O
) O
now B-INCORRECT
they O
can O
see O
it O
happening O
themselves O
as O
is O
this B-INCORRECT
allows O
them O
make O
their O
own O
informed O
judgment O
about O
the O
event O
; B-INCORRECT
if O
a O
reaction O
necessary- B-INCORRECT
such O
gathering O
opposition O
certain O
law O
-- B-INCORRECT
be O
made B-INCORRECT
immediately O
while O
emotions O
are O
still O
strong O
before O
action O
finalized O
. O

As B-INCORRECT
well B-INCORRECT
, O
the O
fact O
that O
so O
many O
people O
( O
especially O
in O
US O
) O
have O
television O
sets O
means O
everybody O
at O
least O
who O
watches O
receives O
same O
inflow O
of O
information O
and O
ideas O
. O

So O
, B-INCORRECT
for O
example O
people O
in O
Spain O
can O
be O
informed O
about O
how O
California O
or O
Japan O
speak O
and O
act O
this B-INCORRECT
allows O
from O
different O
cultures O
to O
come O
together O
discuss O
ideas O
. O

In O
my O
opinion O
, O
this O
is O
one O
part O
of O
the O
process O
making O
world O
a O
" O
smaller O
more O
unified O
place O
or O
global O
village O
as O
journalist O
has O
called O
Information O
Age O
. O

Not O
only O
the O
news O
, B-INCORRECT
but O
also O
entertainment O
is B-INCORRECT
an O
important O
practical O
function O
of O
television O
through B-INCORRECT
as O
literature O
and O
drama O
people O
learn O
different O
messages O
about O
life O
. O

They O
can O
see O
various O
actions O
acted O
out O
to O
their O
ends O
, O
and O
understand O
the O
consequences O
of O
these O
without O
having O
perform O
same O
experience O
for O
themselves O
. O

Unfortunately O
these B-INCORRECT
TV O
shows O
are O
not O
always O
accurate O
portrayals O
of O
real O
life O
and O
have O
a O
tendency O
to O
glorify O
violence O
, O
as O
well O
making O
seem O
the B-INCORRECT
good O
guy O
wins O
lives O
thru B-INCORRECT
dangerous O
situations O
. O

However O
, O
this O
sense O
of O
reality O
is O
not O
so O
distorted O
and O
hidden O
that O
people O
are O
going O
around O
acting O
like O
Superman O
. O

As O
long O
as O
one O
has O
a O
well O
- O
developed O
sense O
of O
reality O
, O
TV O
can O
be O
an O
excellent O
tool O
for O
understanding O
the O
world O
we O
live O
in O
. O

The O
waters O
of O
the O
culunary B-INCORRECT
seas O
have B-INCORRECT
been O
calm O
and O
consistant B-INCORRECT
for O
centuries O
. O

Progress O
has B-INCORRECT
move B-INCORRECT
slow B-INCORRECT
like O
the O
tides O
and O
constant O
rythm B-INCORRECT
of O
waves O
have B-INCORRECT
showed O
little O
changed B-INCORRECT
. O

However O
with B-INCORRECT
the O
daybreak B-INCORRECT
of O
twentyth B-INCORRECT
century O
a B-INCORRECT
storm O
has B-INCORRECT
brewed O
. O

With O
this O
storm O
the O
waters O
have B-INCORRECT
churned O
and O
spawned O
a O
wave O
that O
has O
crashed O
upon O
rocks O
of O
every O
kitchen O
. O

This O
wave O
is O
the O
microwave O
. O

Never O
before O
has O
such O
an O
invention O
revolutionized O
a O
science O
like O
this O
. O

A O
complete O
break O
has O
been O
forged O
in O
the O
way O
food O
is O
prepared O
. O

At O
the O
dawn O
of O
time O
, O
cave B-INCORRECT
men B-INCORRECT
cooked O
animal O
flesh O
over O
open O
fires O
. O

As O
History B-INCORRECT
progressed O
, O
spits O
and O
barbeques O
emerged O
. O

Technology O
saw O
the O
advent O
of O
wood O
stove O
, O
and O
later O
ones B-INCORRECT
fueled O
by O
coal O
. O

Modern O
times O
saw O
gas O
and O
electric O
ranges O
as B-INCORRECT
to B-INCORRECT
staple O
. O

All O
these O
things O
had O
one O
thing O
in O
common O
: O
FIRE O
. O

Flame B-INCORRECT
, O
the O
source O
of O
life O
always B-INCORRECT
used O
to O
prepare O
fool B-INCORRECT
mankind O
throughout O
History B-INCORRECT
. O

However O
, O
the O
microwave O
uses O
radiation O
to O
excite O
water O
particles O
in O
food O
thus O
creating O
friction O
which O
creates O
heat O
. O

This O
is O
a O
prime O
example O
of O
thinking O
that O
does O
not O
follow O
in O
old O
footsteps O
but O
breaks O
away O
from O
convention O
and O
forges O
new O
routes O
. O

If O
this O
were O
not O
amazing O
enough O
, O
the O
microwave O
cuts O
cooking O
time O
in O
half O
. O

If O
you O
had O
told O
someone O
100 O
yrs B-INCORRECT
ago O
that O
could O
cut O
cooking O
time O
in O
half O
, O
and O
not O
use O
fire O
they O
would O
have O
thought O
crazy O
or O
bewitched O
under O
the O
influence O
of O
heavy O
drugs O
. O

In O
an O
age O
where O
time O
is O
the O
scarcest O
comodity B-INCORRECT
, O
our O
society O
has O
embraced O
this O
eliminator O
of O
wasted O
hours O
in O
kitchen O
. O

A O
mother O
who O
works O
, O
can B-INCORRECT
come O
home O
whip O
up O
something O
in O
minutes O
the O
microwave O
whereas O
before O
she O
would O
have O
been O
slaving O
kitchen O
. O

The O
microwave O
is O
excellent O
for O
re O
- O
heating O
making B-INCORRECT
it O
easier O
people O
to O
make O
excess O
food O
be O
eaten O
later O
. O

Again O
time B-INCORRECT
is O
conserved O
-- O
Children B-INCORRECT
are O
able O
to O
use O
this O
simple O
device O
without O
parental O
fear O
of O
fires O
starting O
. O

For O
As B-INCORRECT
I O
have O
said O
before O
, O
there O
is O
no O
fire O
! O

This O
marvel O
of O
technology O
has O
helped O
propel O
people O
into O
the O
dizzing B-INCORRECT
pace O
life O
that O
most O
us O
lead O
in O
20th O
century O
. O

Throughout O
History B-INCORRECT
one O
can O
see O
that O
great O
revelations O
in O
all O
areas O
come O
from O
breaks O
tradition O
, O
new O
insights O
and O
differents B-INCORRECT
perspectives O
. O

All O
these O
were O
needed O
to O
create O
the O
microwave O
which B-INCORRECT
is O
essential O
nowadays O
. O

Eating O
is O
something O
everyone O
must O
do O
. O

This O
device O
has O
sped O
up O
one O
of O
our O
most O
important O
activities O
and O
thus O
revolutionized O
life O
in O
the O
fast O
paced B-INCORRECT
20th O
century O
. O

When O
I O
was O
in O
tenth O
grade O
a B-INCORRECT
teacher O
said O
that O
the O
2 O
most O
important O
inventions O
made O
possible O
idea O
of O
repressive O
government O
were O
machine O
gun O
and O
radio O
. O

A O
machine O
gun O
can O
be O
used O
to O
keep O
civil O
peace O
, O
enforce O
Marshall O
Law O
. O

The O
radio O
can O
be O
used O
to O
communicate O
ideas O
and O
under B-INCORRECT
a O
dictatorship O
, O
propaganda O
. O

In O
the B-INCORRECT
20th O
Century O
machine O
gun O
has O
not O
changed O
all O
that O
many O
lives O
( O
except O
for O
those O
it O
' B-INCORRECT
s B-INCORRECT
killed O
) O
, O
but O
invention O
of O
radio O
made B-INCORRECT
a O
tremendous O
impact O
. O

The O
idea O
behind O
the O
radio O
is O
simple O
. O

There O
is O
one O
transmitter O
and O
it O
sends O
its O
signals O
through O
the O
air O
, B-INCORRECT
waves O
with O
potential O
for O
millions O
of O
receivers O
. O

In O
the O
20th O
Century O
radio B-INCORRECT
has O
become O
a O
source O
of O
information O
and O
entertainment O
. O

Radio O
keeps O
people O
informed O
. O

I O
don O
' O
t O
think O
any O
people O
of O
my O
generation O
can O
even O
comprehend O
now B-INCORRECT
our B-INCORRECT
lives B-INCORRECT
would B-INCORRECT
be B-INCORRECT
different B-INCORRECT
. O

Every O
morning O
I O
listen O
for O
the O
weather O
forcast B-INCORRECT
and O
dress O
accordingly O
. O

At O
night O
one B-INCORRECT
can O
sit O
by O
the O
radio O
and O
hear O
how O
events O
of O
day O
unfolded O
. O

Radio O
, O
hence O
gives O
people O
the O
option O
of O
becoming O
passive O
observers O
rather O
than O
active O
participants O
in O
news O
making B-INCORRECT
process O
. O

Newspapers O
had O
been O
around O
for O
many O
years O
but O
it O
was O
not O
until O
the O
invention O
of O
radio O
that O
power O
media O
became O
evident O
. O

Radio O
gives O
the O
ability O
to O
reach O
many O
more O
people O
, O
instantly O
. O

As O
a O
form O
of O
entertainment O
, O
radio O
and O
its O
most O
important O
now O
more O
common O
offshoot O
television O
has O
changed O
people O
's O
lives O
. O

A O
typical O
day O
for O
a O
child O
in O
today O
's O
world O
, O
consists O
of O
going O
to O
school O
and O
coming O
home O
watch O
T.V. B-INCORRECT

There O
have O
even O
been O

The O
parts O
of O
the O
new O
machine O
that O
need O
oiled B-INCORRECT
and O
regulated O
. O

When O
Voltaire O
wrote O
Candide O
, O
a O
literary O
style O
known O
as O
Neoclassicism O
was O
at O
its O
peak O
. O

There O
was O
a O
group O
of O
scholars O
in O
France O
, O
l'Academie O
Français B-INCORRECT
that O
set O
guidelines O
for O
French O
literature O
. O

According O
to O
l'Academie O
Français B-INCORRECT
, O
all O
literature O
of O
the O
Neoclassic B-INCORRECT
period O
must O
follow O
rules O
propriety O
which O
regulated O
author O
should O
avoid O
certain O
topics O
including O
sex O
violence O
church O
and O
state O
issues O
. O

Another O
standard O
upheld O
by O
the O
Academie O
is O
idea O
of O
verisimilitude O
, O
making O
literature O
as O
realistic O
possible O
keeping O
time O
setting O
and O
plot O
true O
to O
life O
. O

Voltaire O
, O
as O
a O
Neoclassicist O
knew O
all O
these O
regulations O
and O
followed O
them O
in O
his O
literature O
. O

However O
, O
when O
writing O
Candide O
Voltaire O
defied O
the O
Academie O
's O
rules O
. O

Candide O
is O
a O
parody O
on O
the O
guidelines O
of O
Neoclassicism O
. O

Neoclassicists O
liked O
for O
literature O
to O
have O
good O
manners O
: O
they O
did O
not O
want O
step O
on O
anyone O
's O
toes O
by O
mentioning O
sex O
, O
violence O
church O
or O
state O
issues O
. O

In O
Candide O
Voltaire B-INCORRECT
did O
not O
seem O
to O
mind O
stepping O
on O
toes O
- O
in O
fact O
, O
he O
smashing O
feet O
! O

Voltaire O
went O
beyond O
the O
comfort O
level O
when O
he O
mentioned O
sex O
. O

He O
told O
of O
the O
two O
girls O
Orellion O
who O
were O
lovers O
monkeys O
, O
and O
Baron O
bathed O
with O
Musselman B-INCORRECT
was O
punished O
for O
his O
homosexual O
act O
. O

Sex O
turned O
into O
violence O
when O
Cunegonde O
was O
being O
raped O
by O
a O
Barber O
, O
and O
witnessed O
his O
murder O
while O
he O
on O
top O
of O
her O
. O

The O
wise O
old O
woman O
underwent O
the O
removal O
of O
a O
buttock O
by O
pirates O
, O
as O
well O
experiencing O
rape O
. O

After O
the O
Baron O
is O
caught O
bathing O
with O
Mussalman B-INCORRECT
, O
he O
receives O
100 O
lashes O
for O
his O
sin O
. O

Candide O
stabs O
the O
Baron O
, O
a O
Jesuit O
Priest O
after O
forbids O
Candides B-INCORRECT
marriage O
to O
Cunegonde O
. O

Ironically O
, O
although O
Voltaire O
mentions O
many O
acts O
of O
violence O
each O
act O
is O
treated O
lightly O
: O
Cunegonde O
and O
the O
old O
woman O
both O
tell O
their O
tales O
being O
defiled O
like O
an O
entertaining O
story O
in O
conversations O
about O
travels O
; O
Baron O
also O
continues O
his O
tale O
with O
style O
after O
telling O
beating O
Candide O
" O
kills O
he O
leaves O
to O
search O
for O
no O
second O
thought O
until O
reencounters B-INCORRECT
later O
. O

The O
light O
attitude O
in O
which O
these O
acts O
of O
sex O
and O
violence O
are O
written O
shows O
the O
parody O
form O
Voltaire O
writes B-INCORRECT
Candide O
. O

Voltaire O
chooses O
not O
to O
stay O
away O
from O
the B-INCORRECT
church O
and O
state O
issues O
. O

He O
attracts O
the O
hippocracy B-INCORRECT
of O
Church O
in O
old O
woman O
's O
father O
being O
Pope O
. O

When O
Candide O
visits O
the O
land O
of O
Eldorado O
, O
Voltaire O
shows O
people O
's O
perfect O
relationship O
to O
God O
: O
they O
only O
praise O
because O
there O
is O
nothing O
want O
from O
. O

Voltaire O
uses O
this O
perfect O
relationship O
to O
God O
in O
an O
unrealistic O
situation O
foil O
society O
's O
imperfect O
with O
the O
real O
world O
. O

Voltaire O
makes O
fun O
of O
aristocracy O
in O
his O
description O
the O
Baron O
, O
who O
came O
from O
71 O
generations O
nobility O
but O
still O
lacks O
gentilesse B-INCORRECT

Candide O
and O

companions O

According O

Desegragation B-INCORRECT

The O

is O

I O
would O

the O

That O
person O
would O
then O
feel O
obligated O
to O
do O
nice O
things O
back O
and O
return O

. O

This O
is O
based O
on O
eauity B-INCORRECT
theory O

It O
would O
be O
better O
for O
the O

to O
do O
nice O

it O
ask O

Someone O
who O

may O
not O

After O

for O
a O
while O
, O
they O
may O
adopt O
southern O
attitudes O
toward O
Blacks O
and O

This O
is O
conformity O

The O
same O
goes O
for O
Southerners O
who O
move O
north O
. O

They O
come O
to O
feel O
prejudice O

Jews O

I O
know O
someone O
who O
has O

all O
over O
the O

He O
is O
prejudice B-INCORRECT
toward O
Jews O
, O
Blacks O
and O
Mexicans O
. O

He O
adopted O
white O
attitudes O
against O

in O
the O
different O

has O
lived O

Our O
country O
has O
been O
coined B-INCORRECT
a O
" O
melting O
- O
pot O
inferring B-INCORRECT
that B-INCORRECT
we B-INCORRECT
all B-INCORRECT
come B-INCORRECT
from B-INCORRECT
different B-INCORRECT
background B-INCORRECT
but O
have O
joined O
or O
melted O
together O
to O
produce O
homogeneous O
Americans O
. O

But O
a O
persons B-INCORRECT
heritage O
, O
as O
we O
are O
realizing O
is O
important O
to O
their O
sense O
of O
self O
and O
community O
. O

Ethnic O
American O
cultures O
have O
been O
reviving O
and O
trying O
to O
reestablish O
roots O
that O
were O
once O
lopped O
off O
a O
model O
U.S. O
citizen O
. O

The O
differences O
they O
are O
rediscovering O
only O
add O
more O
color O
, O
flavor O
and O
excitement O
to O
that O
brewing O
" O
pot O
of O
our O
people O
. O

However O
, O
some O
individuals O
and O
even O
groups O
of O
Americans O
are O
reacting O
negatively O
to O
this O
ethnic O
explosion O
( O
seen O
most O
clearly O
through O
the O
arts O
) O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
accept O
these O
differences O
. O

They O
choose O
to O
remain O
indifferent O
the O
plights O
of O
their O
fellow O
Americans O
. O

As O
Ellie O
Weisel O
, O
author O
of O
such O
books O
as O
Night O
says O
about O
indifference O
: O
it O
is O
the O
opposite O
everything O
good O
. O

The O
opposite O
of O
love O
, O
beauty O
intelligence O
light O
joy O
life O
and O
growth O
are O
not O
their O
familiar O
ontonyms B-INCORRECT
but O
indifference O
. O

Ethnic O
American O
literature O
tries O
to O
fight O
this O
indifference O
by O
vividly O
and O
uniquely O
expressing O
certain O
aspects O
of O
different O
culture B-INCORRECT
. O

The O
gamut O
of O
ethnic O
American O
literature O
is O
without O
bounds O
. O

Each O
group O
has O
its O
own O
peculiarities O
and O
attributes O
that O
make O
it O
's B-INCORRECT
writing O
unique O
. O

In O
many O
cases O
the B-INCORRECT
words O
used O
in O
ethnic O
American O
literature O
reflect O
a O
knowledge O
of O
different O
" O
mother O
tongue O
. O

For O
instance O
, O
Native O
Americans B-INCORRECT
poetry O
is O
more O
expressive O
and O
visual O
partly O
because O
their O
language O
deeply O
rooted O
in O
the O
observation O
of O
natural O
environment O
. O

Chinese O
American O
Literature O
is O
philisophical O
/ O
literal O
because O
their O
native O
language O
so O
. O

African O
American O
literature O
is O
often O
melodious O
and O
rhythmic O
mirroring B-INCORRECT
their O
similar O
achievements O
in O
Jazzy B-INCORRECT
Blues O
music O
. O

All O
these O
examples O
( O
and O
more O
) O
give O
us O
some O
insight O
to B-INCORRECT
other O
cultures O
we O
would O
otherwise O
never O
know O
. O

The O
stories O
told O
in O
this O
genre O
of O
literature O
, O
however O
are O
likely O
the O
most O
important O
aspect O
Ethnic O
American O
. O

It O
is O
through O
the O
experiences O
of O
characters O
that O
we O
learn O
about O
different O
cultures O
in O
United O
States O
. O

When O
we B-INCORRECT
learn O
of O
the O
trials O
and O
hardships O
that O
they O
went O
through O
can O
sympethize B-INCORRECT
with O
their O
emotions O
try O
to O
accept O
diversity O
. O

The O
stories O
of O
black O
American O
slaves O
and O
concentration O
camp O
victems B-INCORRECT
are O
necessary O
to O
avoid O
indifference O
. O

Without O
learning O
about O
the O
past O
( O
and O
present O
) O
horrors O
there B-INCORRECT
is O
no O
way O
to O
ensure O
future O
humanity O
. O

Ethnic O
American O
literature O
benefits O
U.S. O
citizens O
in O
many O
ways O
. O

It O
opens O
our O
eyes O
to O
the O
reality O
of O
suffering O
others O
. O

It O
gives O
us O
a O
fresh O
and O
new O
perspective O
on O
the O
world O
around O
. O

It O
helps O
us O
to O
understand O
our O
personal O
relationships O
better O
. O

Most O
of O
all O
, O
it O
gives O
us O
more O
common O
ground O
on O
which O
to O
live O
and O
grow O
prosper O
. O

Hopefully O
we B-INCORRECT
will O
someday O
fulfill O
Elie O
Weisel O
's O
goal O
and O
end O
indifference O
; B-INCORRECT
this B-INCORRECT
literature O
is O
a O
step O
in B-INCORRECT
the O
right O
direction O
towards O
acceptance O

Violence O

Many O

watch O

because O
the O
action O
thrills O
them O
and O
can O
sometimes O
cause O
