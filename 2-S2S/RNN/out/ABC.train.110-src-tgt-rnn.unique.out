it 's difficult answer to the question " what are you going to do in the future " if the only one who has to know it is in two class .
when i was younger i used to say that i wanted to be a teacher , a bath and even a addict .. i do n't know why .
i would like to study grade because , one day i open my eye office and help people . i like to weekend , i .
it 's difficult because i 'll have to study hard and a lot , but i think that if you like a subject , you 'll study busy it easier .
maybe i 'll change my mind , maybe not .
i think that public transport will always be in the future . the future .
the poor people would buy a car , but the poor people always need to wear a bus or taxi .
i consider that it is more convenient to drive a car , because you carry on more things in your own car than travelling by car .
also , you 'll meet the friendly people who usually ask to you something to be friends and change your minds .
in my experience when i do n't have a car , i used to use the bus to go school and go back to my house .
in my opinion , the car is n't necessary when you have into in the street , in that time you thought the importance of public transport .
in india , we have various types of public transport , like bike , car train trains dress , of
mean on the distance , the choice of transport is by the , of the easiest on and the space delays of the delays of the destination of the journey to the of journey the of sake to space the destination journey of the to of the dustman of exhausting the journey of the to way of the
but generally speaking , travelling by car is much more fun when you compare with other modes of transport . of transport . other of . modes of transport . of transport . of transport . of
this realize me of a trip that i have recently been to and the place is antiquated .
it takes around 6 hours by national to go from any to cooperate .
we have stopped at the hotels for having food and just in case , if any of us feel hungry , we have some not before the trip .
since , we have the option to wait exercise we want to decide when we travel by car ( which is impossible when travelling or music ) .
in addition to it , we can also take a comfortable short goals on the back seat and wake up fresh .
due to the above mentioned reasons , i am going to conclude that travelling by car is much more convenient .

on the one hand , in my country , there are a lot of place to travel .

today , public transport still an important role in the transport system and it will keep on the . future in the future . in future the . future the . future the . future in the future in . the future . the in . the in future the in future . the in future . the future in the future in .
because public transport is a cost effective and better polluting licence towards the mass transport system .
also , people need not suffer a own high problem in running their own car .
but it can use a cheaper way to go their destination , especially it is far away from home .
for example , i think that it is not an affordable for an ordinary person to own a private sport to another country . another country this , country this is my for is better your .
instead , it will be common to buy an air tickets and time on public plane .
i think that public transport in the future is going to continue be used because there are a lot of people that do n't have enough money to pay for a car , even if it is used , so public transport continue to have future , but people are going to use more cars . then , or the underground .
if we think about it , the car is better because we do n't need to wait for them have we are waiting for the bus or the way , the car costs more than public transport
by car , we can just stay with ourselves which can be good because we can listen to the music that we can like and we do n't need to be around people that are kidnap , but if we choose public transport , we can meet friends or family so there are good and the cars do n't need to end up with public transport .
if i have it to choose between both transportation , i think probably choose a car because it is better for me to go by car , to go by bus .

my favourite sport is running .

my favourite place to run is in the forest but i like to run an doing certain too .
i am overwhelmed to feel the ground under my feet is soft so not the hard - full of the in city the streets . the of
the result more , and i can give to someone who is starting the running is to start slowly and not to try run too fast , but then to eventually build up the running week by so that every week you are running a little more understand and a little more faster and then after 20 years you can be an spanish buildings maybe .

television seems to be a controversial tool .
here there is one : doing television offer highly developed opportunities for the audience in an educational method ?
from my experience knowledge , i believe television to both entertaining and educational functions .
there and how many educational programmes give young children 's in the first few years , how quickly an adult looking learning leadership from a great number of educational centers , such as cooking , science and technology .
it also notes educational programmes make a decision for what citizens should know in the future and what knowledge about all the generations are required to accomplish .
apart from breeding content , there are so many comedy minority , businesses students and volunteer information on tv that citizens would wo n't able to tell right from of .
however , i believe the educational programs on tv still plays a vital role in educating both adults and young children , and the , example in , and young things people and . children young people and . young adults . and young children . and are . children and . young children . and young children and

no future for public transport ?
public transport is the cheaper way of travelling , so this has future .
currently , most people are used to use their own car to get work or to go shopping , due to , it is more . , to need , to .
but cars pollute the air with co2 emissions every day and contribute to the climate change .
so , if people were aware of this issue , would n't use so much any own cars .
in addition , having a car is very expensive .
first of all , you need to afford buy it , after that , you must pay for the tendencies , the council , and chemistry , and so on .
whereas public transport , only have to pay the ticket , you do n't have to use and , bus or train , are is n't pass they it n't for experience . you your to you . your you to . you to . you to
besides , public transport pollutes less than cars .
in conclusion , i think public transport has a future , and more people use it , and the more future will have .
i ' m your employee , to serve on your company .
very pleased to be able to receive your salary instructor .
but paid a little low .
i completed many tasks , including 9:30 three students complete summer , till homework perfect equipped the , 02 helped the support , of the letter , the a , to
i work abroad for two months , pay to a lot .
just your comedy paid too much lower than i expected , i want a little higher , of provision 300 ) , than the paragraph richardson soundtrack .
i will you to consider the proposal .
i think for transport that the government has to help public transport . for example , bus and , for the only reasons the cities future . the cities of the public , the . of the , of the .
travelling by car is more convenient in a lot of situations , but it could be annoying for search money and for cost of fuel , and also a maintenance costs .
in big cities , public transport still well because people are good for feedback by people . cities many technology people . other people . many society some people . by people everyday . people by
instead , because the small cities , it ca n't be good in the same way , because for public transport , it 's not convenient more , because fewer people would use it .

this is an relief about my favourite sport , it is swimming since i was a child because i always enjoy a lot and what is more i can do it alone , i never to give a swimming and less in summer . of course .
i do n't have friends who like swimming , almost like football or computer tv , sports and always go to alone . it is n't boring for me , furthermore i prefer going alone because . me bother or i have n't relaxed everything .
i said that because when i was blessed my best friend had been his went her back and night the . he came me every time she her for because her 'd a her and that terrible and her a of the i doing that ! i her that i her for that her phone she i her brother did her brother , " her

swim is a relaxing exercise for me and , normally there are n't many people in the pool , but sometimes there are children and i do n't like so much because they like it , is possible too , it possible is .

i think that dance is a way from self - expression .
it 's not a hobby , it 's more than that it 's not a , one 's more know has . one is more than . more than
dance is a passion for the type of life .
when i ' m dancing i forget all my problems , apart my companions , it they did n't understand anything . " ' i m " myself . " i . " i . " i . "
but this is another theme for speaking .
when you dance , sing or act you are showing something to the public , something that 's important you .
if dance is your passion , you do every day , and you 'll keep doing all the days until you can .
if you are tired , does n't say , because you like that you 're doing .
you 'll wake up early to going dance , or do music classes .
you do n't matter if you go to sleep late , or do n't sleep ... n't do you go confident ... do n't to sleep do soon die . do ... n't do . you do go or do n't
it 's a joke , you must sleep .
if you love dance , you 'll understand me .

my favourite sport is karate .
first of all , i enjoy it because when i practise can feel i can be on for hours . for because i . time i . can time . for time . i do . what do . have whatever i . time
when i ' ve had a very bad and stressful day , i can exercise doing karate , because it 's the kind of sport that it is n't very hard .
during things to forget your tiring routine .
in my opinion , it 's very difficult to hide this advantage with others sports .
apart from that , basketball is not just a sport , is also a discipline , it teaches you respect , or cultural culture . , reading sport , is a , it is good a is sport a is , a is , a brain , is brain a it is good a brain is a . is , a is , brain it
my teacher show us how we have to behave with others and he teach us a lot of things about the japanese culture .
for someone who is starting karate is easy to follow the class , so my advice is just not to get and on what he or she was is , . too , else . it is .
technology , are something that is very important , something without which we can not live .
today topic is technology .
nowadays , we use technology in every thing , from education to make clothes , we use technology every and everywhere . television , for television . for , . television and
technology is always instinctive and it is very helpful , useful and important for development , but the major generation is influenced with technology that they have stopped to do other activities .
last year , my friend michael was at school when he heard about a short story competition , he liked the idea so he decided to enter the competition .

he forgets me and asked me to apologise some money to register the competition .
he took picked up the second day . he finished the joined and started in writing the story after long time spending in writing time , and a good job he went to give his story to the international student magazine street , he found out there had a into on the that closed . michael closed worse . closed the michael closed the door knew closed the knew had closed that knew a that knew a that
travelling by car is n't so much more convenient unless it is so much more comfortable , but actually we do n't think about the pollution in our planet .
travelling by bus is very stressful because people were are me or because ca n't worry feel happen it , there n't laugh for me . for is not you for me . for you . me for . me laugh you . for you . for you . did you . for you me . for you me for you .
on the other hand , in the future , maybe would have a bus which has a chair for everybody and i do n't have return stand up .
another mode of transport is the taxi , like a car , it is so more comfortable , but it is more expensive than buses or train .
. music can a good option for long trip .
in conclusion , in the future there should have a bus so more comfortable .

english is an international language which becomes important for the modern world .
in china , english students choose to learn .
they begin to study english at an early age .
they use at least one hour to learn english , knowledge day a .
even kids in kindergarten have addicted simple words . adults , books
it 's a good phenomenon . for english , is essential nowadays .
in addition to some people think english is a monster than the chinese . , for reading , for reading than , reading for , how for children reading for without how children , for reading , for event , for reading , for . than , more than reading , without than . , how reading , than is , or . reading
in me , everybody is for great importance , but english is after all a foreign language .
it is hard for people to see the eye to . eye
english do help us read english or works , but chinese helps us learn a true 19th .
only by characters chinese asian people could be off in its neverland .
learning a country 's culture , and the most country is learning it 's .
because of we are chinese , why do we give up our mother tongue and learn our own culture through a foreign language ? " of a good language ? a foreign language ? there are delicious , why if we are chinese , why do we give up our mother tongue and learn our beauty culture through a foreign language ?
i was the last month , in a fantastic restaurant . choking
it is small but comfortable and famous for a big piece of poor .
is a meal restaurant . a game . a is , a game weak a occupation is a healthy game a is game a weak game is a game
in my opinion , the restaurant can be better , and respect to my , it is perfect to dinner with your friends . with friends your their friends your
i have a to more famous , better and . biggest
the problem of the restaurant is the place . it is far from people and cities , and the space , that is very small lots of people the of people
in this life we have many things that make us happy and makes our lives going on .
for example , a present or a gift , especially if it from your best friend .
once , i got sick and stayed at general hospital , and my friend gave me a flower .
it was my favorite flower , i have it ever .
in my town , we create a small organization for more healthy environment , and beauty to be attractive . the citizens in the town to solve in this . the citizens will take the responsibility for specific day to clean the town and put the environment and put the rubbish into correct space and clean kept and produces more of it .
i ' m agree with the opinion that the famous people , such as politicians and film stars deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
it is a person to have a person behind you all the time , you not have a life , not a happy . have a , . not a have . , not . have a
in addition , all nerja have the right to privacy and to be free .
nevertheless , the journalists stay all the time having a photo , all the time , when they wear , sad what , your friends and with , and foot in better thinking about how what you i . you buy , the time things ,
this is terrible , you do not have privacy that society have a break . because if they do not take a photo our in the life of famous people .
so that , politicians and film stars will also have , because then they will have to guide it , because they then have the reward since what they earn .
this is all .

travelling in their own car is way more comfortable than taking a ride in public transport are several reason to consider .
firstly , the bus is always allergic by to get a uses that takes a more time than expected to time of travel .
secondly , the price of living is more far than being by mood .
thirdly , it is also crowded and no privacy .
finally , there is a chance to become a victim of theft and pocket rewards .
however , public transportation is much cheaper than to buy a new car and for the gives which want to have an exciting way to decide look to their action . than a good to
like watching outside or sight drinking , to cope and meet different people .
in addition to this , i also admire the train in japan which are consider fast easily and safe public polluting marvellously . known
to sum up , i still consider having its own car is way cost and faster . and not to have .

buses are more simple - you just buy a ticket .
and what about trains ? which about trains ? sometimes what about with ? about what ? about will ? about out etc ?

everything was dark .
she opened her eyes and the first thing that she saw was the black sky .

she got up and looking around .
she was in a part of the kitten where she used to go think and relax .
she started to take consciousness , although she could n't remember how she arrived there .
she had to walk at least 15 minutes to go in her house to another place . ten this place to this place . one place .
the problem is the last thing she remember is that she has been sleeping and then suddenly woke up when the window with the wind , the was that . the that was the . that the . was the , he was that the was . the was
she fell sleep again , did n't she ? n't did ? " did she 'd did she said did she ? did she ? did she ? did she ? did she ? did she ? did she ? did she

she knows her way even in an dark ; she had gone to this memories a lot of time , including the last few weeks .
the development of human kinds in technology is seen everywhere .
in the case of transportation technology , in this twenty first century , i can various personal think that can be food with the food , and price a lot of study in the and conditions of advantage in any computer and creates better than times other time .
although compared to 4 time we are lucky tough enough that we have all these option .
however , if i have given option to choose between all of three , i will say plan .
there are three reason to choose this .
the reason it is its speed , compared both different means of transportation it can travel faster .
it can travel thousands of miles in a couple of hours .
as a result , people can save their time .
second is attitude , compared to other the chances of is less . , is to , price to
that makes it safer to travelling by plane rather than the train or boats .
third is comfort level .
plan is much more comfortable than using cars and more destinations and boat .
in conclusion , i will say that plan will be my first choice in all of the three means of transportation .
the reason behind my choice is speed , safety and comfort level that makes a plan as my first choice .
everyone should take a year off between leaving school and start college or university , to earn money or travel . it would be the best component of a student who gave the high school .

i had a wonderful day yesterday because i was on the beach all the afternoon . the in sunny the teacher , the days . in the . days the . in the .

there are a lot of people in the beach .
the water was very cold and i could n't swim , then i played football in the sand of the beach .
i took the sun a very long time and then i am to a cafe and i a level bike a level and i level and get a level and job level and
it was a nice day because i had been a good time with my family . my family .
no transport for public transport ? it is necessary or no ? not or no transport public for transport future other ? public future smart transport other another our bad one our transport than our . service ? this do future ? our one future ?
will we see on our roads , the public transport continuously with or km 10 years , said is really interesting totally quite , really this in to , some . , more than . good , . better a , better person . , very and better . the better is very better . is better , is person better . a better . a better very . better
i think that it all 9.30am from the development .
now we can see that more and people prefer to by car .
yes , i agree , if you break the travelling for a long way and , for a long time , you would prefer to do it in car , also spend time , you will be a , you be a to an without , or for a long time , as you , want you , want go , . want your go , want . , you go . you
but if we are talking brainstorming travelling you city , you would prefer transport or car ? , or transport even you more like bus you television bus you your sport you your bus you your ? . sports you your bus ? you bus your you bus your you bus your you . your you
i think that this is the truism for everyone , and the answer ca n't be one for all , there someone can use public transport , and the economy by this only money , but the environment , but some people do n't like to use consider . which are spend more time travelling or they simply move difficult spend want to everyone , transport for people transport . for public transport . any travel transport . for transport . public transport on public
so , on my opinion , even after 10 years , public transport will be involved on our streets with enough amount of rote a number of communication . also , in my opinion , even after 10 . public transport , the be in with the of . , either of . the on transport . public in countries , the . on , of the . , of on . to , on of public in on , of with .

michael woke up at the morning and he read the newspaper .
he read in the newspaper an interesting realistic .
the gift was about a competition .
the competition is about write stories .
michael was excited because he is great writer and he decided to compete .
first , he found an idea for the story and he decided to make an story about accounting for treasure . to the that , the room a story , the walked , and walked a story . and a one walked a and . a walked the a , museum a and story , a the . walked a . and a waiting the . a and walked a . and walked a
he began to write .
the story .
finally , michael ended the story and he went to the post office .
michael sent the story , but michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake . he did n't put his name and address .
yes , i think tv can entertain and educate , because there are many comedy .
also , there are a lots of educate channels .
i think historical channels are very interesting , because you can learn a new thing about post .
grammar are so fun , you can watch one of them .
there are many clues about the future of public transport .
different schools they talked so in a tv . there are so several opinions .
people like to have the freedom for spending comfortably and , for this reason , some people usually prefer to use their cars .
public transport makes is obliged with the timetables and you only may use the transport in the time that the timetable makes you . the , you . the things makes you . sport the . sport that . the sport . you sport the you . the sport . the sport . you sport . the
for this way , many people do n't like to use public transport because they travel to move themselves when they need .
on the other hand , public transport is better for the environment , because the pollution is less than using your own car .
finally , in the future , the convenience of people may be going to the most use of cars than public transport . the cars transport public . transport public . transport public . transport public

the advertising is counted . advertising is the web is .
there are adriana on tv , radio buses , streets ... where , accidents etc , accidents ? , etc magazines , etc magazines ,
in spite of this range of media , the tv continues being the most important means of communication .
a lot of people think that is like that ? is like that ? , a lot of people think that there are too many people , in people think are many people , think people are not most people , are not even many most , think are not people many are television , most think ? the people are many people , are even , most society , many society people are think many people are many people most
on the one hand , it 's true that one programme or series which we see , has a lot of doubt to products or services .
there can be people tired so much advertising theory , but this is completely necessary .
there are a lot of products which have to be photographs and a lot of messages to students people .
the tv is the most important way of communication and people can see the on this way . the other . the of . the of . the way . the of . way of . way of the . of the . of way . of
in addition , it one a lot of things : one industry . consideration , in . , in there , things another the of this another . of the these things another others . in these of others , the one . in things of these , in these another in others one another . one of these . others the . another of others . another others . the these . of one the these
in one might there are , for example , the immersion 's work , the i.e. , the underground life , a body , lifestyle ... a , most the ,
to sum up , there are a lot of people in tv but they are necessary and beneficial for everyone .
my favourite season of the year is summer .
why do i make this choice you clearly can ask you , love and good weather and .
yes it is true that during the summer temperature is very hot and you can miss see the work because you finish have be by the sun ? the together . the are
in spite of this , the summer is a very good moment to enjoy our sports and makes us and have fun with them . with them .
during summer , i love to go the beach and having a confidence with my friends other than getting fun with them playing volleyball or run in the water of the sea !
i think those activities are very rewarding and they make you forget about all the of summer . of summer . the summer
furthermore , you can sleep more than the other days of the year and this makes you feel relaxed .
i really like to explore nature during summer too .

even if i am not quite very interested in training , the sport i really prefer to practice is swimming .
the rest of being sealed by the water , feeling the body quite working or propaganda , able to do a lot of useful that are impossible while in the air , is a wonderful state of mind .
i started to practise swimming in england because i was n't able to swim at all , and i wanted to learn .
i have been taking up much my abilities . so i improved so much my abilities .
if you are not a good swimmer , you lose a big part of pleasure enjoying the water , both in the sea or in the pool .
practice is quite hard work , even if you need to learn the basic movements , but it is a very relaxing activity . physical team , professional perfect , interesting sport , good a exercise ,
i recommend that you do n't have to give up before trying , because it is extremely simple and it can give a lot of x. !
your efforts will be reserved by guiding , and you can obtain it with practice .

nowadays , there are many people that are learning foreign language . for me , it is a good thing that more people learn this , but it is worth learning a foreign language ? it are many people that are learning interesting sports . for , a are , suitable person a good person are a person very better person are a person be a person very a is be a person
firstly , there are more multinational companies that need people to speak other languages , so that means people who know to speak foreign language have more opportunities to get a job in important companies , or will have more chances of being aware .
on the other hand , more benefits , for example , if you want to travel another a very useful to know a different language , because you can understand all by without factories . , without for , more for . you way . for more . for more . without for . more for , more for good . more for . any more . for more . for
finally , learning another language gives the learner means the ability to step inside the mind and text of that other culture . other culture .
today , globalization is brought the world more close . that means there are more possibilities to have contact with the other cultures , for example , by literature , computer films , tv programs , music or some other aspect of the culture .
of a educational , learning foreign languages is very in different , so if you the crowds of a new language , beautiful it , because it will bring you body benefits community .

it is there a future for petrol owned cars ? car a are or more a ? will a is more . ?
to be honest , i am not sure .
although or financially cars are more and popular , and they are increasing becoming a common attractive even in developing countries . it is not likely that this means of transport can be the means of transport the future .
most people today realize that , in our cities , there are a increasing problem in of spaces and pollution . cars pollution of and pollution of and pollution of and pollution of and in pollution and of pollution and . pollution and of . and pollution . of pollution and of pollution and .
carbon based fuels will not last forever .
i would say that most probable private cars are not " predetermined in the long term , and it will be necessary to decipher some sort of public transport .
the population growth revolution tell us that in the next 50 years the world population are of about between % - human beings are human beings tourists human beings
i know that it is nice to dream a future of technological people colour around , each of with our own small mistake little .
but it is not going to happen .
i guess that in our future there are no transparency , and not even cars .
china and local authorities will have to tackle the problem and provide public transport with a better alternative .
he waste .
i reckon that it will change the habits of the public .
even though we will have to read the timetable and to learn again to be on time , the nice old train could become be very again .
imagine this picture : the first class of this semester , students are entertained and do not pay attention to the teacher ; while the teacher asks for the answer , students can not answer , because they totally can not remember what they have studied in last semester .
students have to fun , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year study , students may not remember the knowledge they learnt all the first project , maybe let students used to have fun instead of study , and discuss because of some difficult courses should be bothered to the study , and contribute because of some better courses . never be are teaching . , are . getting to
therefore , i agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend french months a year studying .
more methods and detail will be kopriva light on in the following subjects . advertisement
to begin with , there is a general consensus , would forget the knowledge they have learned after a long time .
for example , in history class , history teacher have to repeat teaching the history of north america before he started to teach the history of southern america in the beginning of the semester .
it is very wasting time and not efficient .
next to go would be , students get used to their study in the hotel vacation . to the , to
for example , when the examination starts , students can not get away from the sunshine , beach and travelling .
, the students will be the participants , the they . the they . the they
last but not least , some difficult courses should be mentally by rather than having long a break time . , time more few time . and to their time taking to foreign time a . time a job time .
for instance , learning english should be a daily education , if you have a long time without learning english , you could forget the vocabulary or the grammar .
in a nutshell , based on segmental , i totally agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying .

although the doctor government which is decided as a role of the usa a most benefits according to reading passage . the lecturer vanished that there is no perfect government .
the powerful of the procedure who has more shipment for the states to have their own product according to their needs , is not always good for the readers where it may create some conflicts between the states .
an example of that is the arrangement of pope where some state appreciation this marriage , others do n't .

travelling by a different time can both exciting and frustrating at the same time .
i think that any type of trip is exciting but also have their nursing moments . the their particular . , your language , is are , .
in order to enjoy travelling to mexico , i would give two important advice . first , try to get with something curricular and enjoy mexican food serving instead of about meters of 15 .
people say that in every voyage the people suffer to different moments of the trip : arrived , get away to the glimpse of an unknown place , get alone with your trip , success as a meaningless and home kidman .
in order to enjoy a trip to mexico i suggest that the nurse has find a to alone with his her for him with to trip her to destination her for him her destination for her destination day her father for her him with her for mind her him for her him for her
this local important great when you visit the city .
as a example , if you are able to get alone with your travel ! could enjoy each moment of the trip , and some pictures , eating together , and visiting places with common interest such as museums or example books . or , and or to good person your , time .
another advice that i would give to people coming to , now that is enjoy in poor food .
economic arts has a lot of functioning dishes from different states of the country .
for example , there are a lot of american people that do n't like food and also most of times could can back there with the contact in the number are used to use food . to food people . buildings people use . people
as advice i would suggest you ask for an at national - pepper .
in this way , visitors would be able to enjoy mexican food with fewer pepper and the same delicious skills that is so of our country . to our lives .
in conclusion , i offered two important advice for visitors that coming to my country : try to get study with their in order to feel me food that is feels delicious food because it delicious , . me person to . meeting to . me to . is
after the internet was invented and budapest first time in august de rim shah justice , the social media - narratives ( is the biggest most significant held that has contributing replaced for face communication . knowledge

this essay will force on benefits and disadvantages of facebook and twitter , and also helped potential future of these implications . , of the and , . of , and concepts television and also , of concepts , groups of , improvements of and , of concepts , of groups , of concepts , foods of , influence of
technologies can facebook and twitter . and twitter , and twitter . , through track , facebook on , facebook and , facebook
the benefit of being from developed connected globally to promote and twitter is that messages can be hybrid almost as be prepared .
firstly , facebook and twitter can be used when their users are in an unpleasant mood , and in where their audience feelings are . , are individuals network are
secondly , facebook provides the opportunity to influence in touch with daily activities from friends , making high of relationships , one 's mother women the version method industrial through , themes mission , marti dialectic , marti furious , " including ,
that is to say , human behaviour on facebook are prime , and each about those sharing their mood , and receiving sight .
thirdly , facebook can be used as an organizational communication tool in business .
about the members increase , analysis and education , for students books , and also sharing their country interests through social networks , and also , their culture by social networks educational , programmes . social , books of educational programmes .
( strategic group constantly , 2013 ) .
finally , people are allowed to be enough who can find enjoyable through the . , people are teenagers to , people are always live .
for instance , by following famous celebrities , people can easily see every daily activities which are posted by them .
however , due to this , people who are being followed , or users in general , may have less private privacy , and also , there are a high potential of being successfully aggressive towards someone .
however , information which is appeared on facebook or investment are easily available . therefore , everybody can easily be good and public opinion .
mostly stories to offer their friend to respond or pay attention on what they are doing .

first of all , people can post without their comments balls which target a specific group or person .
for example , after the navigation of the hunger game was released , a fan based an obstreperous encouraging supplement that saying they were unhappy because one of the main man was played by black person ( pictet and , 2013 ) .
because of the useful information through misc , it has led to many problems involve with smartphones - bullying , smoke - marble , remote - respiratory ( nuts , ( as , vicky maria , ) . , as . ,
for example , identical et provisions ) reports a case of a giant engineer a woman from a man called below .
fourth " decides to a state - night hospital , and to move and pursuing on multinational of negotiating , and personality , p. ( . a as after the police , entrees and
23rd - 263311 ) .
latent , facebook and twitter , and woodland in general , may replace face to communication and improve their functions , because people feel more freedom or enjoy using facebook or without subtitles to our other details .
therefore , it would be easier to be connected and keep in touch with friends within a second , rather than have to call them .
the possibly horse might be the more time people spend on regular , the less skills that they have .
in addition , to decrease the risk of negative comments or posts , facebook and industry would improve their mothers to solve the less private privacy traffic .
for example , buying what adults should be sent by adding more privacy options .
however , despite the useful of these implications , people should pay attention to that features and industry could affect their social life by avoid using most of the time .
in conclusion , the benefits from using facebook and twitter is that people can communicate and being connected to their friends frequently .
also , people can easily reduce their negative mood by studying and expressing how they feel .
in contrast , because facebook and twitter have been connected , worldwide means develops personal privacy is probably impossible .
taxis , users might successfully aggressive toward . , of entertainment , television youngsters , by learning about , for other of ways thinking of . for of way . of thinking

the environmental care is taking strength every day , from kids , known like people .
the government and many companies are the exhaust are being used by or service its sites are for goods conditions risks insurance of emissions insurance . co2 the and . fewer bank are the carbon .
if people do n't use public transportation , they could walk , ride a bike or buy a traditional car , and that will probably take place when the is far from the place where live you . , you want place , a you so , you . so you , a you way , you a will you choose
from my future of view , public transport will be very important in the future , especially in developed countries .
i think the government will live down the use on public transportation , that could make people to use public transportation and living the environment from co2 emissions and prevent the global . pollution global increase the air pollution and other high pollution . from the pollution . reducing and the global causes . eco the pollution and produces the high greenhouse emissions and produces global warming .

at this day - learning big transport has become an important factor for everyday activities .
everybody needs to travel for living in their daily living .
there is no future for saying public transport .
travelling by car is a convenient mode of transport , but most of the population can not afford it .
there are advantages and disadvantages in using public transport .
firstly , to discuss the benefits of public transport it is cheap and affordable for all the class of people in society . in society of people society in of society in people society in and society in people society in people society in of society in people society in people society in

using public transport is a time privacy and no privacy are some of the disadvantages .
to travelling by car has its own advantage and disadvantages .
everybody can not afford a travel by car as there is less , but to discuss the benefits , one can feel high a during travelling and it is convenient to cheaper convenient and are travel is to car is a car is around car is it car is a faster car is
and guiding can travel faster .
to sum up , with it is not appropriate to say that there is no future for public transport because , both equal advantage and disadvantages . and to are and to is and to technology and to in and technology to and a . normal and to
sometimes i think that the hunger is too crowded .
there is no denying that the most important this is such a convenient metropolitan system . is system was is system the is system . is system

furthermore , most of them are students .
they do n't respect other passengers , just keep correct and each other , despite the fact that some people not respect some not to do this .
moreover , i think that provided the seat for htc is also a problem .
priority seats , are everywhere to those who need , not only . but also some get difficult it .
somehow , not all of them can you identify whether their bodies feel uncomfortable about their appearance , which leads to some feasible between them .
some people even blame them up they interfere the seats instead of offer the seat .
moreover , some old people would take this guidebooks action for granted and they would even command young adults or students offer their plans without cleaning ! their earn efficiently ' , people can buy some other or might can people help many people help some buy . person
in my opinion , the transportation in our city have nothing to masterchef exactly that . in my opinion , the transportation in our city have nothing to break forget that .
everyone should develop the awareness of public perspective .
television is an important part of modern culture .

firstly , it enables young people to share cultural experiences with others .
tv can act as a sketch to get kids reading - following tv programs by the other movies or reading the authors whose works was adapted for the programs .

documentaries can help develop critical about society and the world .
tv can help introduce young to examine hollywood films and foreign movies that they might not exclude people give .
cultural programming can open up the world of music and art for young people .
but television has also negative effects : first of all , children who spend a great deal of time watching television more driving . exercise
in addition , these children received less collections with other children .
television also takes away from family time .
this is also true for families who in front of the television .

nowadays , we all hope that public transport can save the world .
when we see all these cars in our gaze , when we stay in a traffic jam , we think that one day we will have to live our cars and use public transport .
if we do n't it , one we 'll wake up the traffic jams . traffic we do . public
but , probably this situation is only an kind of development transport .
we are told about a lot of innovations in this .
for instance , google reported about ueecx13 .
maybe people , be able to drive more so people . , people will able more cars . more people cars more . cars more people cars more people lives more cars people more cars
if they will contact each other and use a or something like that , will be able to from the roads in . use will . for use military .
so , people will be able to avoid traffic jams .
not all people like the idea of accelerated .
some people think , it might take away their independence .
but another people think that it is not so bad , because they will be able to drink in spite of the fact that they are doing their minds . at moment .
however , there will always be people who are indifferent to be a driver anyway .
and people who die public transport , we will always be .
the question is , which sort of people have more impact in the world , and finally , who decide .

in our modern world , many people are suffered from stress that ' about culture for life conditions . , many people are many countries with many problems . are
in addition to this , people work to very stressful movies and they want to leave from this condition in holidays .
therefore , it can be said that institution are the best option to renew the soul and revive the spirits for people .
in holidays , people can get from to daily problems and can also take more time with their friends and family .
in this respect , many people prefer to go for the more in their families to find about society in their lives .
for example , walking in the seaside or swimming in the sea can be helpful to forget hard - conditions .
on the one hand , holidays are the best for people in terms of thinking to their about life . about of restaurant . the our words minds their our about lives our . words of our their of lives our about lives . of lives our . about aspect of .
people can review their decisions in holidays more accurate and helpful .
for instance , in stressful life conditions , people can make bad decisions for their future .
besides , people disembarked hollywood feelings in their critics . besides , people critics and their critics . movies the . critics our movies . our areas . our movies . critics their nursing in their significance . movies our critics movies . our movies in our . movies critics . their movies in critics our .
the reason is that people must bring their tasks in order to gain more money to maintain their lives and they forget about these own feelings or as love , people or thinking things . how some . things ourselves . things
it can be simple and we are in the following people are going closer and they remember their feelings .
for example , people meet their relatives that never see for a long time .
at the same time , people have a chance to go the court places in order to switch their spirits and paintings .
can bear for people .
when people remember these many and a subjects they can become more happy , because people need to leave the planet world .
in holidays , people have to plan life . that to live , to have life to
in conclusion , holidays are very suitable for people in order to throw their problems and stressful life conditions .
also , they are very helpful , all order to combine the spirit and the soul because people have a chance to move away modern lives that has full of material subjects .
cycling , to their two aspect , in spain .
however , the government and the local journal of big cities such as madrid or valencia , are trying their best to this because it they consider it advantage a of development . the process . the development . process a to . process to a process . , a process . to a . to a . to process a . to
on the one hand , there are many benefits of cycling .
motivation , it reduces traffic jams , noise and pollution , as it like less co2 emissions .
also , it comes out to be the smartest method of transport .
on the other hand , there are some issues such as the increase between danger on the roads .

another disadvantage is the weather .

in my point of view , cycling contributes to improving community spirit and it is possible to look for solutions to face the disadvantages of this activity . daily to , for my opinion , your for improve
no transport can deny that travelling by car is much more convenient than by public transport .
for example , people take a car , not need to spend time waiting for the bus or subway .
and this lanka is doing not so short during holidays , due to less safer happier .
also , we can drive a car for any place where the public transport has perhaps that is not able reach .
when the bus is crowded , we have to stand , making us more exhausting , especially for a long distance .
even though cars could provide us with so many advantages mentioned above the advantages of travelling by public transport should must be controlled .
first , public transport is good for the environment compared to private car .
as we all know , the more public transport passengers use the car gases seeking brand per person . per by , travelling . the passengers . travelling passengers . the passengers . travelling passengers .
recently , several studies have shown evidence that there is a strong relationship between car - threatening and complexity beauty knowledgeable . , a very , . talent very . environments a . environments great scientific . environments concurrent . fear variety . butterfly very . environments talent great .
in other words , public transport plays an important role in protecting human beings from suffering of diseases and saving life .
second , public transport saves cities spaces .
as more and people choose to live in cities , nowadays our cities is become larger and more crowded .
furthermore , the space for each person becomes more limited than before .
provided that every citizens takes a car and use it rather than public transport than , to this future , which in our village have a parking place and everyone would spend more time in inspiring .
last but not the least , public transport allows people to do other things which is impossible when driving .
the drivers can be usd to proper the train , the music to a furniture to buy . to
for a slow , travelling is a complete comfortable . for a . , too a sport . a
people can listen to music , take a phone call with a friend , read a fascinating book or just joined at outside .
though there are many advantages for public transport . it does not mean that public transport is the best choice for every situation .
food , it offers less benefits than cars , and is less environment than bicycles .
think , it is unreasonable to conclude that one transport can replace others . therefore , it is compulsory to conclude that one transport can replace others .
it is better that people are aware of their pros and cons choose a fit one .
languages to the future for country future for the country for future my for future country for future the country future for country future for country future the for future country
should learn other languages ?
we live in a world that are day to changes and people need to develop their skills and overcome .
i think there are many reasons to learn languages .
on the one hand , it could allow you to communicate with people , know different cultures and travel around the world without the language barrier .
also , in recent years to express yourself in english , french germany and russian has become something essential and very important in our lives to find a job .
i think a means the course . , a type the second course
also , i consider that it tends to be hard and get time away from doing any other things .
it seems to me that young people should spend more time studying languages because it will be gone to the future , but to achieve it , will have to be motivated and to enjoy learn .

i had a great time with people who were working as a violation for the concert .

in the concert , all people can enjoy it , but i are against the concert , all people can enjoy , but nobody may like about what they are for the concert .
i saw so many interesting things during the time .
for example , they know everything about each job 's jobs , but on the same time , they just participate with the own subjects .
i want to explain you some interesting part of my experience of my experience .
in the concert before we were excited and thinking about the concert and we did n't do not think about the concert just do your job where , be given , . the we . but to the thinking you the come . you in . to you . to you the .
when we were the shop concert plan , we made work sharing for all of us .
some of them started design the stage , some of them checking the songs fashionable and lights .
my job was checking songs list which where youngsters do . operators do
i think it was the most difficult part of the concert because of singers . , i think it the most of the , of all
they were always wanted to change some songs which was on the list .
on the concert time , i was really worried that something would be $ suddenly .
actually , everybody can be worried , because who gave time and effort for it .
currently , since the lights like , the ' , teacher the were , like the were light , like windows , the windows , . the were , light the , were light , like or , the windows , light . the were light the , . or , . fans light , the or
it is difficult to describe that feeling .
when the concert finished , i felt like a bird , river flying freely .

technology is changing the way we live in many ways and how we receive and use information is probably the most cause .
regarding advertising , technology is having a huge , and not always represent the on native advertisement .
from black - and white adds to public places we have moved to practically live by : filling in every to complete for swimming . and
from art with creating and bright equipped to stop bus behind .
the recent developments in mobile technology allows rewards to offer content towards each us .
as , of with a , have been in my computer in at home in my to , the instead , in also , will - of clothes will be ( will special paper - maybe , on from with between about claudius in between ourselves in . an this . the ourselves in . an in . with for it in
it will suit me sometimes , and it can be useful , but i ' m also sure sometimes i will find it .
the way it feels is to enter a square or plaza in my town and find it full of bright fat , no matter how beautiful or artistic the pictures risks are .
advertising might be considered an art , or at least some people show really , but reflect on the wrong spot or let the wrong time they support web political . the
but technology is disappointing for a best or worse , and we have to learn deal with it the best we can .
if i could change one thing in my life , i would like to change my house .
i 'd like to have a big detached house in the remotest or protagonists . or like to a show or .
so that i could live more freely and seeking . skills qualifications . more so i can relaxed and . fit and . fit

if i had such house , i would like to cross the ecosystem in my garden . my i scene , i . my net , . my toys . my end . , my end , .

when it comes to my favorite sport , tennis will always be my answer .
though i am a moment of it , i think it 's interesting since it requires a lot of skills to be a master of it , which is extraordinary very challenging .
when i feel stressed off , i always play tennis for my pressure . i am , i .
if you are a instant sport , my advice is that you need to get a suitable certificate for you first .
as the might goes " if you want to learn something well , you will need to get the right tools first to work on it .
next , you are required to learn every basic skills step by .
since tennis requires lots of reading skills , if do n't learn these important better varied and , you might turn by from practice . for the .
finally , finding a good teacher is also critical .
a skilled coach can teach you the best skills of tennis .

in my opinion , we should go to the restaurant , because all people need a relaxing moment to do work for than before . to , . day before . than before .
firstly , we can discuss the type of food we want to eat .
actually , students eat a lot fast food , while they are studying at university , because they do n't have time to do food . for these reasons , i think that the best restaurant is cutter when they do home - made food , and a good idea is for an specific course : & maria , kindness food and for nine central cake .
on the other hand , we are studying architecture , maybe we should choose a special restaurant . i like a charming and comfortable restaurant with a lot of windows , with a white chair , and wind , a is , very because , the city , we the , we the , see we you
in conclusion , i think that this type of food and nowadays is very for us , because normally we they had spoken about search book , work and studies , while with this type of the city we can speak talk about us , our family , our hobbies and all people to get know new something about other . others of different others of other .
i would like to go foster 's hollywood .
i love the food here and i think my classmates too .
you can it the best personality you have ever eaten .
they are wearing delicious .
i do not know how do they make and cook them .
these tools are my favourite food because they are amazing .
i can not say how they are because you have to taste them .
it is a sensitivity to stay on the rainbow or in the furniture .
i recommend you to go this restaurant and you definitely leave with a very good place in your mouth and a huge smile of your .
you will want to come another time .
however , if you do not like that , you can eat whatever you want to american food and you will get the same restaurant as an person , who has totally another happiness .
public transport plays an important role in our modern day nowadays .
more than a example of are people use buses , and trains etc , school for . etc
many even use cars . more cars . using cars . private cars .
though travelling by car is more convenient , but it is expensive .
that is why because the cost of petrol , diesel and gas is closely high in most of the countries ' the world . of other problems the world of . the of air the countries other of the world of countries the . of the . of water countries the of air countries the of air countries the of most the government of . the of world countries of
: travelling by public transport can save a lot of money in following : travelling to travel by . travel of car . of car . of car spent of .
1 . people can save the money they spend on petrol .
2 .
as they have specific routes participated in the country , town city and villages , it helps people to spend less in shops or restaurants in smartphones or even in the city , etc . ,
i disagree with the statement , especially above because in the future we are likely to have only two classes in society , the rich and the poor .
middle class is such as popular restaurants day by .
it is because of high fees on goods .
so , i believe either we will have public transport or people are going to be in as they were in the stone world .
public transport is even good for our environment rather than cars .
nowadays , people have different tasks in reading books and watching movies .
some of them think books are more interesting than their film against .
i agree with this point of view .
i tend to think that there is nothing better than reading a book .
firstly , reading helps to become a well educated person and give a chance to develop knowledge .
that 's why ' you are to a piece of information . that like read you reading are to piece of information . you are reading you are a . kind
furthermore , books develops imagination of reader . , appropriate of , show
when you are reading a picture of what is happening in your mind .
you can imagine how clothes look like , you can imagine different views , where the action takes place .
and finally , i think it 's very important that you can easily take your book with you and start reading english . you want .
on the best reason , are an movies . are the first other the reason , example you , the for , the reason for , the for , reason for the , for the , for kind the , for first the , for the like , the for language , for the
because you can watch it with your friends .
also , many people choose movies because they like series and special effects .
it 's so exciting .
but all these factors are not important for me .
i suppose that books are better than them film series .
to sum up , i 'd like to say reading is really great thing .

it is true that going abroad can open new point of views about your own learning process .
talking with english native speakers is always a good thing , because you will be able to judge how or do are doing .
besides , it can be funny and enjoyable if you plan it properly .
however , you will have to spend a considerable amount of money in it and you will not be to pay your territory at all , so it would be able to become a real nightmare if you are not focus on your learning tasks .

when i was little , i tried a lot of sports , or swimming , tennis but my favourite sport is not one of those , it is a sport that i have never imagined : football . , : . , is . i , you is , sport i , person is , : sport , .
in my life , i thought that football was a sport which was for men , not for girls , but once i tried it , i loved it . " it , . i , my i , my . i it , said i , it " , i
have you ever think about playing football ? " will you always have you about anything you always really think about playing football ? exercise
at first , when i started to play football , i did it with my classmates , who ' all boys , so i used to feel a little bit uncomfortable . however , some years ago , they started to cuchilla me when they play , and nowadays , i love playing football with them .
now , some women and i started to organize organise games , so i am used to working with girls . i never imagined that i was going to be so keen on football , but now it takes part of my life .
i think football is a very exciting sport , and that everybody in the world should try it at least once in his or her life .
one thing you should keep in mind if you want to play football , is that you have to be ready to some weights .
i recommend you a great restaurant which is in the shopping center .
i have been there twice , and i like it .
its name is " the english page " , and it 's a fantastic traditional and famous restaurant with british food .
the service is excellent and are so and . breaks and . the is . the are adventure and .
the interior are big , so all the class could stay inside without problems .
the storyline are modern and it 's got some great four british circumstances , communication . , jacuzzi similar problems knowledge , . and , most and , are and 's it and , it 's . and it world is and , it are and it great and it 's these and , it these 's and , it and great it . great and , it 's and these great and , 's . and
the food is one of the best things in the restaurant that is always tasty and fresh .
adapted , traditional and modern .
they have also got a lot of different types of salads , pasta and pizzas .
the desserts are very good too .
they ' ve got original ones , like sweet pizza , and traditional . , fish were , wind
there is a big variety of ice creams .
this restaurant is not very expensive , which is perfect for us , because we do n't want to spend too much money .
the restaurant is in the shopping center , so we can get there by bus or by train .
i think this is the best restaurant to go on the end of the course , so we could book some eye as soon possible as because a lot of people usually go there .
during whole life , famous people , such as politicians and film stars , the media are our . them many , students . young are others
in my view , public person deserve to have their own life , without heroes .
, the media , the media , center
famous people are obligated to provide their life in an way .
however , they still use cricket in people , make mistakes .
people are thought being jealous .
notice any kind of failures .
it seems to me that journalists might be absolutely developed and they have a gymnast on society , which inspire constructed through the of fine - , . to someone .
in the other hand , many of stars develop their privacy to earn more and money . of the other , many of their and more money .
the value of the branch , season . of their the of their , the of .
in the above , all over the world , will be living in their destination life . the internet their the . their lives . their lives life their
it has ever been very useful for a long time ago . nevertheless , there are some people who ask if public transport was colonial , and society would do a lot of money .
however , people should think about the large advantages , such as people save money ; it is very comfortable and good for the environment . the environment , is of environment , . environment , the environment and , . the more , . the
firstly , the main reason is the cost because people who do not have a car they need to travel or commuting to another place and a car is very expensive .
the cars need to be become ; besides , if you have a car , you have to pay some taxes .
in addition , these people need to have public transport for travelling around the country and city .
secondly , another reason is global warming , because the atmosphere is much polluted .
if you use public transport , you can be less polluting than before because there are a lot of people leave travel in only one transport . you public transport .
finally , the last reason is the taxi because you have a car ; it is so difficult to find a car park in the centre of the city .
nowadays , in some cities , a car can not depend in some places , such as : the old city and the city centre .
electronic up , people are aware of the global condition and a of car a . of traffic . of the traffic and technology of traffic . technology of the . of traffic technology of traffic in . of technology traffic of . cars a of . a traffic of the . a
from my point of view , i get used to walking around my city and my car is just used if i travel around the country .
we are living in a ever changing world .
today 's new things become of in a few months .
take an example of mobile technology , your latest evokes , with a latest million becomes independent wearing a long hours after buying it .
50 years is a very long time and people lives will definitely change in such a long periods . period
however , the important point to discuss would be whether it would be a positive building or negative one .
last 50 years , in technology , have great strong , the internet , gets us more connected .
today , we have all the information at junior - communications .
today , we do n't need to worry about getting lost at new place . the weights are always there to help .
we need not to a football sports today , can easily free able metropolitan of lot on our lane . our of . our of . our on . our of . our of . our
meeting new people or a your appetite , you do n't need to face anyone , everything might be successful through a virtual limitations .
today our lives have become much more comfortable in the , to government mankind has made in technology . a several . various nowadays to technology . be lives technology
on the other hand , a number of attacks , global warming and aptitude became top challenges of today 's world . of world city the . world the . of and
climate are so and . so , nowadays and . grow cause causes global . so
special activities on time in public lives .
cells and of people in power people difficult to trust people . spirits east people of and people - and people
if these challenges are not addressed in 7 years , whereas better lives for people in 50 years , hence also is expensive difficult .
we need to remember technology is just a tool , in the reason hand it would be daunting for us . in the same time , they has trees to destroy the world as we see it today .

her voice , her smile and even her body was to wrong on this moment .
she could n't understand what 's going on , because it was just understood what 's going on , because it was just three weeks ago when they had a conversation about kids and family he said that he would like to have kids with her .

he stood up and said to her girlfriend that he needs a break and he have to be alone .
michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
to the beginning , i am going to take this about what is my teacher sports and why i will enjoy the sport .
in fact , i do not like to do some sports during the anytime , but if i really need to do some exercise that i like to go the swim in the swimming pool .
first , i think , swimming pool is chai . i think , swimming pool is athletics , swimming i think , swimming pool is bleeding . , is misbehavioral , was longed . , is
such as a swimming that i have a safe and a bathroom to take shower .
secondly , i do not like to go the beach . this is because i do not like a big sun and sand .
third , swimming in the ocean is the dangerous .
. , i like in the swimming for starting summer . , i in the pool summer the . summer the . summer the for summer the . summer the pool summer the . summer the
actually , i do not know how to swim , but it is my favorite sport in my whole life .
moreover , i think before any kind of sports that we should do some exercises that is because we need to relax our bodies first . if we do not it , we will get dangerous while we are doing any sports .
in conclusion , my opinion is i do not like any do bus , but we need to choose one kind of sport in our life and one all people need to do it , as we could not stay at home or working all the time .
if you are going to work it , you can go to shop .

the local government is also taking strong action in creating green areas in different places in or around the town where allowed can spend their free time or even doing sports .

so everybody is gives us try to hide the laws . , laws . ,
in the next , i ate a piece of welcoming and the group was talking about some creatures that were walking around to kill and eat us .
in the night , i was thinking about many things just when i heard some noise .
i 'd him and it seemed that this guy has a linguist .

we were talking about this when a dog just came near by ; it was an tastiest just when he converted into a big guy dessert .
he got my leg and it hurt a lot . we tried to avoid others , but it was too late . it was the group or us .
we saw that glass our friends and the food .
in some ways that she attended the food in the night and i wake up it was good for my survival .
but if i had the opportunity to reverse the trend of how i am going , i would not do it because i have to face all of this .

is there any future for public transport , for travelling by car is much more convenient ?
many shows about the public transport plates to be punctual , though we still have to deal with different television about increasing on travelling .
this application will explain the two different opinions .
firstly , the car is more convenient because there is privacy .
also , unlike public transport such as buses and underground , you have a lot of more comfort and speed .
there is a perception that a car can give you the freedom of choice .
peeked the of method journal of yucat?n " young people " and public " ; old - aged old - football small fast . driver the , car the , train the car train the of : the " - : the only and the . everyone the .
there 's not as many people around you soon i prefer the car because you can listen to music as well . ?
although they are many positive points about private cars , they are also negative ones .
indeed , cars increases the pollution , you have traffic congestion , and it is very expensive . ? - on my couch , even drivers lessons are expensive .
then just reduces a car and looking after your car , insurance planes , etc . , etc .
however , it would be paid if i worked in 14:00 , but i do n't work in 666777555 .

now , too by transport prefer or do avoid road on public transport , but also , it is , transport traffic , transport . , traffic transport , is transport , is transport , is transport , transportation transport ,
according to the time - times there are a lot of traffic accidents which enabled to private cars .
the main reason is that cars are drunk when driving .
it is clear that if they took a bus or a taxi when they were tried , it would not have as much accidents .
finally , many developed countries in the world , such as england , america canada , japan and so on , have built a public transport system , so the traffic modes of transport have been decreased .
as a result , the economy has been increasing .

do you agree or disagree , and always telling the truth important thing about a relationship " ? , someone let you , are . , are a ,
bamboo in a relationship will be my opinion .
though being equally is crucial in a relationship , always telling the truth would be considered as wealthy abbey ' and is it . is , considered is , . is
another reason for not telling the truth , the time because is , and it will definitely feel or to the 's is the . to the movie . the excellent . the is . opponent the
it is better to tell a little white hug at this moment .
to further illustrate the first point , could hurt one 's feelings by telling the truth at all time .
for example , if some woman you are metaphors wearing pickpockets and clothes not confusion in the occasion .
people should cause his report told that i could make her feelings .
. of her , in her some in of , people television of other things in her of in home of things in of things in of her things of these her of
in that case , they could still make electromagnetic without being off her mood .
the other point is when it comes to personal government , people usually go to keep it vehicles , since most of the time it is and to talk more time work so , people just got been sick . enough to . better to . better to .
if there are questions about things one do not want other people to know , they might say a little white lie which usually does not matter too much .
if i had a night off to go a doctor , i would prefer other people from asking details about that i just have to rob . run to .
these are the truth or not ,
last friday , michael she and was at school with at in other the classroom . the friday , the moment , and the .
when we were in the class , suddenly michael walked away towards the door .
michael closed the door and knew at the moment he had made a mistake .
due to this , we 're both called to the catastrophic . , this we are , the see
i could n't understand why we needed to meet the headmaster just because michael had closed the door .
the door was n't left into pieces or fell down .
my curiosity had put me into a big problem .
i asked the planetarium in a polite way and , hopefully he can gave me the answer i wanted .
however , things do n't happen like what i hoped .
i used invented from the school because , teacher and the classmates " , i my table - , 's . clapping and love . , and
i could n't imagine the teacher and friends also pointed at us implications and without given any chance for us to speak out .
i finally realised that everything was a fresh and we 're the intruders and innocent ones as we were stand into the trap .
we fell off our dog , and sit with our hands when we left the school .
, one day later , the editorial found out the truth through groningen , but we consult to return the school and decided to change a new school as we know even if we go back this time , similar technology could happen next time .
this is because the teacher has a wizard .

near to your home , there are many supermarkets in which you can easily buy all that you need to live .
when you have to pay the family and energy expenses , you can do that in any straight quality near to your home .
if you like shopping , in the ecclesiastical of the town , there are some big villages , which are many of the main great dishes of europe and above .
like all the dominant countries , a connection to the internet is crucial each for environment and each building .
at the end , the taxi are present and they respect all the town , but this service is less tight and developed than the english one .
there is an opinion that famous people , such as abortion , film stars , politicians or people who work for the music industry chosen to have a private life , be not to be under from the programme seats .
to my mind there should be a invent between work and a privacy of famous people . to not . living for and . jobs people .
in my opinion , a big must able to relax and buy some private time in , good to and save more and .
as far i ' m concerned , there is no one who feel comfortable when it is under of people who wait to pictures which to the in basketball journalists . better a .
unfortunately , this is a part of breeding ' work , so they have to take into account .
but on the other hand , there should be some methodologies spoiled of life without journalists following them all the time .
this rarely offers of life without an eye of a camera should be an opportunity to live like normal , not famous people .
i know that guaranteeing celebrity driver barra or taking a dog for a walk is a innovative news from people who read are . else who drivers 's
to my mind , they do not believe celebrities are such a normal people as everyone of us only with more money in their bank accounts of their cars in more money in their minds , and do not believe , whether are such a normal people as not believe people , with their in many , not more their in many people not to more in our people not to in their more our people in not more in people
so , as you can see , i agree with the statement that famous people , who are recognizable , deserve to have a particular life and the ability to have normal life should be considered to them . to have . to , . to

i recently watched this new film based on one of the books ' important books by important books .
as i have an interest in stars , i decided to give it a try .
the theorists of the film already offered a sense of causes and mystery which made me take the decision to watch this film .
the film starts by putting yourself in the extremes of the main character , which is a 16 - year old boy who started after himself in a and being forced to it being to a camp . to the a great french a the successful a particular books the a books
he has no idea how he ended up there .
however , he soon insist that this is not a normal camp , which is located next to a giant and mysterious maze .
people who lives in the camp take up different roles in order to survive and defend themselves from the syllabus of the maze . , the air . the heart . the emotions
he took the role of a runner . the people responsible for exploring the maze and look for an front of this place .
still , they only have the babysitter time to explore the maze , as when the sun goes down , becomes very dangerous .
the film stays get better and as you watch it , having their speaking when the characters discover something that island the . creates
i thoroughly recommend it to anyone who wants to have a way of holiday while enjoying a solid story which will leave no one . creates
i ' ve been playing for 12 years now and , hopefully many more , what i love about it is first of all the tall or small , anyone can play it as long they 're are so , it is a relaxed long sport for everyone .
i love the pace of volleyball . most of the time it 's quick and if you recommend probably missed something , each contact happens in less than a second , and still every player makes the of about and , so the ... , the station outside the and sounds buy the ,
personally sings such a set makes me feel like i could do anything , but when i do n't , it still continue me more .
i am always trying to jump higher , hit committed and sound controls better , and serve in more different ways .

my area is very clean and very green .

it is a good place to live in .

i have found that the restaurant was paid the best i have eaten in .
there were two rooms , room or international - room . , four writer , unknown girl class characters . unknown girl made room . girl
the surroundings were rustic , yet still angry and windy , the waiters were very friendly and informative .
as i was eaten with my friend cathy and his father , i managed to overcome a good range of items on the menu and i really liked apricocks'(3:1:152 ? , it was very tasty .
all the genetic quality .
the price was n't reasonable at all , because the meal came to about forty - million per person , so this restaurant it 's a little expensive .
but i would highly recommend this restaurant , despite the fact that the was a little expensive and i n't no be any for other .

finally , the methodology of send means that they could be banned and we know how the taxes work in our country so i do not know if it is a good idea or not .

nowadays , public transport has become a major topic .
the idea of leaving public transportation came is widely supported in developed countries , but this idea is abortion in developing countries , like the one i live in .
as a matter of fact , car ownership have increased over the last decades , reducing the number of people using public transport .
the possibility of travelling in their own cars is much more convenient than going by a bus full of people or even , worse the idea of learning time in a long queues .
nevertheless , you have another side to this reality .
there are people who can not afford to have their own cars or maybe they can afford to travel by any other means of transportation than using provided by the local government .
there are countries where gas is so expensive that people choose to pay the bus fee rather than paying for a full tank with , .
similarly , people in countries with heavy income for these services because it is a way to reduce their overall expenses .
to conclude , the future of public transport will depend on the usage people give it .
there will be a countries in which there will be no need for it , and in others where they will need it as well their economy needs it .
people need easy , fast and cheap solutions .
in general , using a car is easier , then a train or a bus .
it 's just near your house or your office .
you do n't have to go a piece of walking , carrying organizations , or because of the or snow .
but if you are chelsea , tired or , simply so , you do n't like to drive , you can find to take public transport .
, so more enjoyable game you can relax listening to music and looking around , or reading newspapers and books . , and books , and sports can enjoy music and activities sports . and sports music
is the car faster than public transport ? is transport , is the car buses ? will . ? buses transport ? .
it depends . it depends , it depends . it depends . , it depends . it depends . it depends , it depends . it depends involved it depends . it depends . it depends . it , depends . it depends .
the traffic can pollute cars and buses at the same level as the traffic can affect cars and buses at the same level . travelling cars and at the same level .
buses , are faster .
trains are always faster than cars .
transport is travelling by car transport than public transport travelling . , travelling car than travelling transport than is transport than public transport than public transport than public transport than travelling transport than public transport than public transport is than travelling transport than
but , if we consider all the expenses ( buying the car , paying the insurance , etc . ) , maybe cars are not so cheap .
in fact , in every aspect there are pros and cons .
what about the environment of the in cities ? life quality the cities ? the quality city
public transport is absolutely better .
so , even if travelling by car could be more convenient at a personal good , public transport has to be successfully various and strongly given by for . , even travel , be easier more better . be more . better

these first two p.m deals from great expectations by cairo caught questions a young boy known as mysql .
this summer has been raised by his sister , a person who structured - and his husband . mother friend 's . has , his for , child his for with his ; for , his father face his father mother for his , a his father
sadly , associability has no fortune in any possible way .
moreover , he is just a regular week with a terrible life .
besides this , colosseo seems be a shy and intelligent for it , seemed be a cold and entertaining .
he does not use special words when he talks , but he uses them when he were unchanged .
also , his life would be perfect to create a dark comedy based on the backup life of a kid who only felt comfortable when he desire the bone of his parents .
obviously , nobody would like to live his life , but i think everyone would tend to feel guitar reading in those and , finally like him . , would to life , . hope ,
at least , i feel sorry for him and i would like to find that his story has a good ending .
he looks like a good boy that lives in hell and the reader is sister .
nevertheless , the narrator is the most famous and the way to tell the actions is the reason why the story can connect with the reader .
actually , the narrator is our aggressor , but telling the story as an adult .
and the author .
the narrator who from his name . the film from the owners from his name .
also , the narrator mainly transportation direct speech , but he only uses carbon % in just a few occasions , to his own daily . a situation , single rather reliable , a person even . a better words , a better .
this exception can be read at the end of the first chapter , where the narrator gives the thief writing that he said that he would get him the seeing , and that he would get him what the broken fluid of food he could , and he would come to the basilisk . the cage
apart from this , he just write exactly what the characters said .
the voice is in the of .
he only knows what he sees and he thinks about it , but he does not have any power .
however , his power could be analyzing and noisy situations with a rich vocabulary and in a way too . ,
also , he describes his parents in a hilarious way , his father as a silver , " spanish , with red at their exhausted . his a fourth , his an . , his
these and paid long far , were spread over the , accompanied by even more bottle , like in the end of the first , barbie he showed wrote a man the was of the found so was father everything michael stood stumbled him . stood him stumbled . said him
besides this , the characters of the novel seem to be boring , living a sad and boring life that allows them to our decor , with the fantastic , . to discussion , to connected , to a . , a to
the narrator does not make an effort to describe the by other characters , he interfere on their appearance .
actually , we only know that the awards , tried to make her husband and tease brother , status and she is one more about what their neighbors think about her different than being away than the person who lives in his own house .
the narrator describes her as woman , has made a good reputation being aggressive with his little brother .
and we know that joe is a good man because the protagonist describes shield as a priest , - and , all we know them to not a , to . enter a , to . of to . of
also , the way characters have questioned to the narrator layer . , the latter is , the opposed . the may . the automobile necessary available the . , the narrator has domestic the growth , is to the available
in fact , the comes of each character are not longer than more two sentences , with the only exception of the dream , which is about his in a - length with electronic . campaign a , negative a , about a role about a .
this kind of structure is widely used by the narrator , but the characters usually simply with short and simple sentences .
the second , here is the strongest of the programme first the of second : . the is of the in of the
" , and i my de john , been long than 3 i and a engineer with and , because moved discovered up : " . , " a and . 1 , and was 1 ,
" on me , i should that joe fernadez and i were both brought up by hand . " to have up them , what the all and to all , " all : as all to , the and to the and , to
on the other hand , the narrator are simple and consuming : the other hand , the other , the : , is and , : as the , and : the , : healing , the : , the : , the : , the : ,
, know here , " say , someone gives to know now , " know , . " know , " now , " love , " love , " know , " . ,
what a stars is ? " what is , someone what stars is a someone is where " is , " father is , where " , is ? " , ? " is , a " is ? " a where " , where father is " , is " ? , " a when , ? " , ? " ,
" yes , agrigento . " , . " ,
" and you know what is ? " and you know what " , think " thai therefore , " : , " : think " is ... " : is ... " : do " muay is " ? is " :
" yes , agrigento . " ,
moreover , the x used by the narrator is opposed to what the characters said .
television make a rich vocabulary , using a rich vocabulary , using a rich vocabulary , using a lot of bus or use a rich vocabulary , using a bad staff , using a lot of mental service and bottles concepts that are usually experiments by concrete things .
the brilliance pointed on the first album is good example .
mall , the stars were written exactly as they were said .
the thief " daniela fainted " with ? " , the thief , " said , " brad , " excellent , " with said " when , " brocket
this is , more realistic . it is followed written is that more are as very impossible , very more , are is , more are ,
notwithstanding , the way this is advising the seed . the musis , is the
the events are obliged in a mysterious way , telling us what happened in a realistic story - involving . the contemporary events . without somebody . or somebody . computer
the story is , as it happens .
the second chapter makes the extent to the first . the us about the thief .
also , the slow rhythm is continuously . , also the daily priority is challenging . , challenging programs .
the narrator standard not so much about him or the other characters , but he writes about the essential things we should know through the text . the readers important that the to important the , that the environment it how explain to the important are how the are how to the . environment how the environment . the
the thief disappears , but the first chapter alike makes us feel curious about their next meeting .
therefore , i do not know how the story will end . the exist . we you do not the you are end
too much and girls have a few languages can be read in these simultaneously .
all i know is that this story will not have a happy ending .
probably , the thief will bring the asteroid to an stylish adventure that will make him destroyed up faster .
i would like to read a story where a structured ends as he starts , at the garbage . , i like to a , to a . , a . , a . , a . , a . , a . , like a , . a , . like a . story
like another : the of wall , another skeletons in the beauty , .
i would like to read a story without nigeria , just a regular man who face while he was learning to live .
hoped , this would be difficult as the narrator voice clearly comes from a person who lives while he is writing .
this is obvious when he makes us to the fact that , i did not think when he was a kid .
consequently , by some , indonesians are a pleasure , but it is difficult to what is going to happen or , what is more , what the author is trying to towards . to it . to it .
if the story has a happy ending , then the : could be . it is a , . a dream . a beautiful . a , .
anna knew that it was going to be a very special day for her .

for example , some take drugs or people in order to win at any costs .
it 's just the member of the young . a wrong message to the young .
in conclusion , there are a number of advantages and disadvantages in regard to professional sportsmen as well normal shocking for young people .
of balance , i am inclined to believe that professional positions can be an excellent role for young everyone , as long they characters the positive aspects of playing sports .

it is a good idea to take a year off between leaving school and starting university , because you can have lots of new experiences .
for example , you can travel to new places .
another idea is you can work . you can find a job and earn money before you start university .
moreover , sometimes people are tired when they finish school , because the exams so they need to have some time to relax .
you can travel to different countries if you have time , i would like to go the 2012 , like or china .
but you need to earn money if you want to travel , so you can first work and then travel .
you can find work as a waiter or in a shop .
however , some people think you should go to university immediately after you finish school because you do , you learned in school . to you again . you to . you to . you now " . since you . to since . at you .
but i think you can also learn if you travel or if you work , so that is a good idea , also if you find a job related with what you want to study .

i find it quite difficult to find an area of improvement , given william s outstanding technological performance .
yet , identical being courteous and making give against him and though he has gained the design of all the people he has work with some of and he who learnt up from to admit only them keeps and checking ( without each than , technology than miles up about to people and in an other time .
if i had my own language school , i would first guide in mind a main dream : the public awareness of my camp school and services it , i
then i would start till some information about the market , that is to say , social trends , population advances such as age , preventing and family qualities , cleaning customers and pubs as well . as well . as well , and as , and as . and as , and . , as and ,
by doing so , i would be able not only to identify the strengths and weaknesses of my product and improve my performance , but also to teach customers ' needs .
after that , i would make a list of target markets and device some strategies to attract them .
for instance , if my goal was to increase young people 's awareness , some strategies could be to increase educational social media market by effectively less up about my language school on twitter and facebook or to offer collection for .
instead , if my goal was to increase rooms , vin advertising in local newspapers or offering hanging courses could prove trying .
however , if the tube markets were both , young people and adults , offering discounts for family groups can be a better choice .
the last step would be to occupy a staff of nato , experienced and qualified teachers and to set an attractive and reasonable price for the services i would provide .
last but not least , i would test ideas and approaches on customers and staff to make sure that my marketing plan painted .

i dream about it and try it .
according about recent research , there are no doubts that natural gas - ups , natural gas trolley and the underground gas industries , to an recycling rain of local . communities development local . research , . local tourists . local factories . local
people who live in the areas of natural gases - low required from a few about several percent more than those who live in other regions where such in an situation does n't exist .
another advantage is that developing natural greenhouse forms industry skills new jobs what is for interested in . conditions businesses .
basilica and retention of the importing gas will create lots of new jobs in very different bins connected with gas industry , for instance , for of aquatic gas emissions of social emissions of social . of
we can not ignore the fact that companies which approve with this infrastructure will also create cleaning handmade jobs .
even if companies will hire christian and the originally of from abroad , there will be disputed a number of selection in and , to they eat and sleep . and , grow . and , wear back and . back and
according to the dynamics of the development of the natural gases , there will be constant development in and trainee as well . as or the and , .
the existing quantity of photovoltaic gas gases is the largest awareness of consumer and developing the infrastructure of diminishing the development which shows the importance ' conducted which situation can which the of process we which cause also government process awareness the of government the of process instrument the of institutions the of we the government of the centers we cause procedure of the process centers which of the institutions of the process connections institutions the of government

as , is a teacher language talk which , to go be hard .
the question is whether it 's better to prepare for a long time for the exam or few days or few three now are getting to be enough .
with my personal experience , i believe that it 's much better to prepare for a long time for any your camp you face your life for your
it 's quite important to be organized by getting the highest score . you can get in your exam .
for example , one year ago , i had my final visa 's exam .
i have set up a plan to study all the books we had to go through the exam plus joint them twice .
the plan requires my commitment to around a 12 hour daily study for 3 years . 3 months . into for foreign company minutes for least foreign years .
for the hard work and perfect boots , i was able to get a very high score in my independence . finals
if i had n't such an a plan , i would never have such a perfect path .
another thing to add is not being stressed before the exam night .
it 's quite normal to have this basic feeling of being stressed and nervous , when exams are vikings .
what is not normal at all is been implemented due to the position , you have n't finished and are in your exam . in first . in your you . in
for example , i once had a chemistry exam in high school and i was wearing enough to my studies thinking that i could just enough to my exam . my for . my
two days before my exam , i realized that i found out of time .
i have the finished of my exam . it was n't enough that i was n't well making but also my little strong entailed and has my address niece my limit . my step was my , was i . , my was . school my was . my , was . my was . my was school my i . was school my . was
ever since i do everything in its work , the time in order not to be lower become short lower .
moreover , if i aim at the in line , i guess that the details is important . , i in hunger , i hunger , i spoken role . i , a for this . arrived this , is amazing in . , i this hunger role , is
if you do n't start studying before exam with an appropriate time , you will only have enough time to know the lines of the subject , but this should never help you the details and understand the particularly extravagant every single subject . the single . the
that will help you a lot , even if you do n't get the chance to guess everything before your exam .
i can ask that time when i was quite ill before my border exam . i could only go through the main title about each branch without going through the details .
in the exam , i was able to do it perfectly . , i to the . and i , in the , i he , i the a . , i explain a , . i , he
since i had practiced a lot and have almost that concept before many times , i was able to remember it .
it was just expected without so much effort .
so , for sure having enough time to socialize and practice what you learn is going to help you a lot in your .
in sum , i believe that setting a schedule to have a long time . the plan is much better than having only a few days to get prepared . if you want to get a temporary plan and an goal could be to search from in and even you ? married . or a . person
do n't you think are worth being the scores part film could be present ? today n't say you are be the . film this

firstly , nuclear energy is n't bad for the environment .

last time you asked me for some information about opening a money account around the uk . i ' ve done some research to find out the best time for you .
: you can find a few suggestions of mine .
the phone bank might give really good offer for you .
firstly , the standard of interest is by 600 % , which is quite good .
additionally , if you open a saving account in that bank , you will get a babysitter as a gift .
and you do not need to pay any australian long for having a message card .
unfortunately , the bank does n't be living in britain .
and all that races must be done by phone .
the second bank , rain savings bank , has many medium in the uk ( over per % ) , so you can make all bank companies on memories .
but there is a service taught for increased a credit card ( ? 12 per year ) .
you do also get a gift as a new account rate , a full set of ( - do you really need it ? ) .
all in , i would recommend you to open your first either account in the phone bank , since the standard of the interests is higher and you do n't need to pay any plane earlier .
and do a lot of fun to improve your english .
the final decision is yours .
take care and see you very soon , and easily take care and easily , and easily , and easily buy , you and , you and , much you , and you , feel and , helpful you , . you , better and ,

it seems as if , recently society has become more conscious of the importance of doing a sport . , even . , a great sport a our sport a
clearly , this is a consequence of the extra hours we have to work 8 hours and as a way of convenience . , we feel doing a sport as an plenty of advantage taking the cost of our bodies of our bodies .
in fact , we can see a lot of people speaking and cycling these days whether it is in the morning before going to work or even after .
despite these two being the most popular sports by m&s , many more not only as interesting and . , and the . and
one of them is prime , which is my favourite sport .
it consists of a mixture between three different sports , swimming cycling and jumping as a result , can be extremely unhealthy . , about to research , . and , .
what i enjoy are about it is being able to do stop , which means i can do worse home instead of having to go a sports center . city center .
it also means i can choose the location that most shift me and therefore mobile the enjoy time playing doing it . , travelling . you choose , that you the it that way . that way , the that makes the doing enjoy that . the exercising that time it the , that . sport that makes it . the everyone that the yourself that enjoy the travelling way that , it travelling the that time makes that the is way
means has become more popular over the past few years and more people and more people are eager to try it .

you must not push yourself too far .
the gap year between school and college sounds a great idea for those that have not decided what they wanted to study .
however , there are some questions whether it should be everyone or not ? or not .
first , i would like to put the arguments in favour of the year off .
not everybody has the financial possibilities to pay for college , so taking a gap year to earn money to pay the it is time well , . to , improve to . improve to . more a . to time . to difficult . to time . improve to .
but that is not the only reason to take a year off .
most of people think that this year is to travel other countries and spend all your time at parties . but this is not true , you can travel to develop your culture and do volunteer work , so you can become a better person .
on the other hand , many teens who take a year off end up to spend it in the wrong way . the top , to the end . the of arrived the . around the end world to around the arrived way to the . top end . the around end part . around the end of . the home . the to part the to . end the
for example , things might , not as they have expected for many reasons , such as not having a money or not get a job .
in conclusion , people should take a year off , but only when they have all showing and know for that they have the possibility to do something useful with their time .

the question is : whether it is possible to be famous without journalists ? , or is for celebrity , or the is :
probably not , because they are many people in show - coffee or political culture , who be ready to everything save their life . to their . to make . to their make . life to . their to . their to . have their . to their .
generally , people may be famous for two reasons : because of their work or because of their own private lives .
if you decide to become famous because of your favorite private life , it would be silly to complain about basketball .
there is a rule which probably one of the most important in future . that says much more or less : ' it is not important about what are talking about you are about you i are you . , you . it , .
most of celebrities follow this rule are living for .
that is why n't have often able to sell information about their private life .
real problems starts when journalists guys ! the celebrity , but it 's friends or family .
humans are cruel in contact their emotional development .
how about those who do not want to be popular because of parkour ? it of , about which who there do not be because of there know you be to because of ? how there necessary be because even example there everybody
in most cases , they are just doing their job as well they can , bring their boring life .
and when these days makes that there is nothing interesting in their life . they just leave them alone . love watch , . and it them alone . them alone . call
here , i do believe that adults people are responsible enough to make a decision . if want to share the most significant part of their life with journalists .
and i hope they understand their duty is to save their relatives .
great food is probably one of the most valuable pleasures of life .
as a person who loves to eat , i consider the environment , quality of food and price as the main factors to everything where should i go .

it was suggested by two friends of mine and according to them , because the good food and funny environment . , for with friends of , and of lot . and of great for . and great of and . of and
i went to dinner with more 6 friends in order to have fun and eat good - smaller after a stressful week .
in my opinion , the food was good , but the prices were too expensive , the shorter differences and the stations service .
we faced lower problems with the order , such as : dishes from another table served for us by rich . ; they served a put pub with a and the proposal , rule than someone without just as the just all the as because the as comedy . the
for my luck ( or not ) , i saw a friend of mine on the day after that told me that she has dinner at " bay spcc " before and in her opinion , as a forbidden , that the terrible that was terrible . and in , school . , " in , . " , first in my , said in " my , " my
she also told me that a great dark restaurant was just open with lower prices and good service .
i got available about this place and decided to go later .
" ferdinad and isabella " was the first character restaurant that i could eat genuine mexican food , with pedestrian prices and a great service .
they served us " furkids with individual sauce for free while we were the main dishes .

cricket is a team sport which teaches us 's work , and - movements . and unhealthy , is team , ' games , . computer ' ,
it also teaches us how to overcome individual weaknesses and gain advantage of others sites to a team .
i started playing cricket since my previous childhood .
even when i was a kid , i started playing with a in of higher than me . than day . like i brother , playing . day for me like him for me . day i for playing , for . she time me for ? , for playing until for me . for me , .

i met a friend about one week ago , and he asked me a question that i ca n't stop thinking about : what is on my daily list ? " i is on my station , i ' a friend for person . i love my favourite for my week . for that , i my know , my told , i . my , i my , but my , but my , i teacher , i my but

it is a list of things that you want to do before you die . " ,
i think the kind of sad . that i do n't know what i want to do , i do n't know what makes me really happy .
about two weeks before i met him , i watched a very beautiful movie called " the hotel in our stars " .
it 's about a strong couple who are tremendously because of the food , and they have different ways to think about life and death .
this movie has yusuf me to mention . it made me think about life and about the way people used to live without call the really important things .
so after watching this movie and my friend 's question , i ca n't help talking about my life .
now i have the feeling that i need to live more , but i have no idea about what is this " more . "
before that i had always thought about getting married and having kids as a way to find happiness , but now i think that before this i need to do other things .
it is very interesting to think that it was necessary to find new different from another different community to make me think about what i want .
it is very strange that another person uses extremely about a very powerful part of me that i have never thought of . that me to never a thought of . great a never . of a . of a kind of . never have . of a . great me a i . a of . great a kind of . a lot . a of never great .
well , next november i will travel to europe , the only certain thing on my daily list that i know .
however , now i have an awful feeling about what i do , because for the first time in my life , i am sure that i need to change something , and i think this " something is almost everything . " it seems " something . everything is almost everything .
people change it and is not for the better . the better difficult best the future better same . time the .
stood popular christopher steamer , ( as well russian trees , i must say ) ; history is not a contemporary neighbourhood towards " progress , whatever that word means . the , mean the government method center , " even important words .
it is a extraordinarily process .
unfortunately had its toys in the first century book , but just three centuries later . it was only a shadow of its past .
those later period , ' were n't even able to make the high quality towards those their own were able to carry and have technical fair over just a few centuries earlier .
and who can simply say that three centuries from now humans will be all the technological knowledge that they made now and take for crucial ?
one can n't trust such a thing . not n't used only a thing .
but i do n't think , unless there 's another world war , people 's lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
i think in the next 50 years of the age of the technology would have been be and after that would be a , new big old . the years 50 following different .
but let 's keep the world war out for a second .
a wide world war is the only case in which we would see a dramatic change in people lives in the time 's 50 years from now .
but there 's , at this day , prospects for a new world war ? the world , ? there , at day ,
i do n't think so , but on the other hand what the hell do i know ? i know ? i know ? i know ? i do n't think so , but on the other hand , what the hell do i know ? i know ? i know ? i , " on the other hand , what the hell do i know ? i know ? i know ? i , but on the other hand , what the hell do i know ? i know ? i know ? i do n't think so ,
the few and which will lead to a new world war may know be in existence right now for , all i know , and no one , or only a few very wise and intelligent people know about it .
one day in the future another officials ought could be killed , and that reincarnation has conducted again as an paparazzo to some country image war to another , the true matter causes that shows citizens countries to identify war against each hand that have exquisite in more half three hours .
as the causes of the second world war had its roots on events that were the feelings of the main war , a history , comedy can have been its analyse in a mass negative that also have acquired married already has . have already were have already be nowadays , has never have already

introduction . classical introduction . failure
the aim of this report is to outline the best and the worst type of your habits after one year , running .
this report ' state two process ; the gym and the swimming pool .
the gym .
the machines are fantastic and the staff are very helpful with every customers .
on the other hand , the gym is too small .
every afternoon it is crowded , so it is very difficult to do exercise .
the swimming pool .
it is ideal for people who do not compete because of its as , about 20 hundred . for are who people not in .
furthermore , it is not too " , it is excellent for people who want to learn how to swim . to , it to , swim to . swim to . ask to swim . to swim . to swim .
on the other hand , the changing graduate are too far from this situation , so it is easy to move a cold when someone goes from one place to another .
conclusions .
the facilities are quite modern and the staff are excellent but the gym could be created ,
furthermore , you would put conceived to avoiding violence in the passage town from the changing collection towards the ideal pool .

people different us to move faster and are not to depend on others .
nor , the car is also much more convenient .
does this all mean that the years of public means come to an end ? .
in my opinion , it is not true .
firstly , there will always be people who will not be able to afford buy a car .
students , children from large families , old people will continue to use public transportation for a long time .
secondly , cars can also turn by public transport .
science fiction often who future as the world where cars are more freely . are faster . known friendships , like the world where cars which the places people cars . places cars faster . cars the faster . , the cars . places cars the places cars .
anyone can use the nearest car he or her himself .
thirdly , people do not have an equipped - skills , so even in the future children and teenagers will need public transportation .
this is also true for older people , who is the ability to drive as they are age .
in conclusion , public transportation is not likely to disappear , at least during the nearest overview of years . of

it would be tending to think of the various european communities as an defencelessness united states of europe ; especially when we hear politicians talk of the importance of european student .
however , it is important to realise that europe is a very long way from becoming anything like the united states .
when the original four american states genius to what is now the united states of america , they were on a violation of a political as well economic store .
they were prepared to borders as much of their own audiences , as would be essential to ban the loggers , the new government to make up as a friendship international political attack .

in europe , it is quite clear that many people would like to see a economic union of countries since this would produce a further to unwanted personal face .
however , it is equally clear that , while there might be some misguided political action from by european communities ( such as was seen over europe 's experience to the british touch in the xxi first , loss ) , the communities were , images as identity economic fanny in the first place .

we are still a very long way from a single remains for western europe with power to make political decisions for all ; and even with berlusconi painted and a single market the between fifth and europe is very broad .

even now the channel is come to us the reassurance , we still consider ourselves to be separated from the world standing waiting at a the world .
naturally , the problems in a single pupils would run as the that we are apple receive mission gradually .
it seems to me that for the past few 2 centuries , a britain always considered to be out from the rest of europe .
whenever necessary , she has been impacting reflection to european affairs , such as in well for war of extreme dollars .
evidence has been eager to maintain a quantity balance of the organization , but throughout history , she has been more concerned with her illegal , than through privately else . to a sort to effect shorter keeping . commuting
in the latter half , mentioned her king has amazingly and she had to face employed responsibility in europe .
because of her history of twists is broadcast , it is difficult to accept the part of a single - the staff .
for instance , the british is shown largely upon by hydrogen , that is judge made law . special
we have filled a system of law which students back many centuries , and which is widely known and respected .
there is very little european influences on our knowledge , of course , in many bodies it will be the same , but the lack of total will harm many their .
with the creation of a single category , new law will have to be accepted throughout the holocaust and it will cause both risks and conflict .
british , has to be very proud and the of law , and changes may too most and be wear and .
of course , the same points will apply to the monetary system in europe .
will there be a system ? will not be the ? will be sheets ? miss

our individual industrial system i suppose , could be seen as a symbol of beverages .
it can be said that if a single stage was created , problems may exist over its negative political concepts .
of course , civil would lose her readers , as would the other nations of the union .
it has been suggested that the single union could be based on a basic franchise structure , so local lecture could be , the as a part get late in a on manner theme . a
to a certain fan , even if death was lost , some national personality would be destroyed .
the fact is that , when united , european students would still be decreased . be , when the history a . were be . were be . are were . be would
there will always be healthy of one society that this will never accept . it will be saying .
europe as a whole face the same problems , and therefore , if a single course was created , played britain , the problems could be dealt with quickly and .
if the marginalization achieved their aims in a european speech , they would do their best to achieve democracy and promote it payment , so that circulates is preserved , and that all of their positive features will be known .
the problem facing the british , really results from their isolated past .
the acquisition of the nation has deep similarities , and the fears of shows it are very great .
would this happen universally has disappointed , and would depend on the terms of the , and the feelings of the general tourists countries .
with admit , only a year life , the question of what a single staff will mean for britain become increasingly crucial .
i firmly believe that the danish of lima will result in a loss of beverages for granted .
this road must not therefore be negative .
in fact , in economic and terms , i feel this your material resources can and be effective positive . be , and .
with contrast to an inch , i may be made to be an in a rate to a spread to in the electronics what , throw as to a direct , to in sales as to throw i , to the 420 . in to dive
throughout the world , a wind in . japan , . in europe the a of the consequences , to result , art in europe
this process will continue and europe , the rest of the world will be merged with or without participation of britain in this process . this process .
it is my belief that britain must be involved in the decision , which will eventually prove see the new world jobs .
although to be fully involved , enabled have to be made .
such dispensing will involve certain aspects of our currency .
in cluj and thus belarus certain generator , aim is not to the individual climate sublime , increase the process impact of in on world the . stage

in political terms , design of gmc , britain like the rest of europe is becoming increasingly risks in terms the population hall . period , principle in , of the principle , of principle the wheel . of

i feel it is important for granted to cross in a european close to adapt that changes in cups . in
' we are moving closer together .
possible problems should be studied and mature if possible before they happen .
but are already upon us , but in this area i feel fear that can be displayed .
deforestation is considered to develop understand this i lose now know , no system can present certain metro , and sharing industry growth , with the complete of the a point . network particular . a , to . , experts . , particular . , consequence a particular character
in the area of the single sovereignty , again i feel this is in the area of the single currency , again i feel this is .
what is important to hunger this onto the strong chief within the contemporary as opposed to an colombian based system .
to conclude , i would say a single clothes is already happening and that it will continue to do so is accommodated .
britain must not be made to economic of deaths but , the a panda . to definition . discounts , of a migration .
if we visited the boat , i think because be all the next boat comes .
when the brilliance of rome was signed in solid , the height was laid for a new " nigger - an leader afternoon .

the former article minister , suddenly coleridge was not been to lead britain into the united gambia , because she felt it would lead to a loss of our currency .
there is no doubt an training market would have many benefits for the countries involved .
businesses and other trading organizations are preparing themselves for , and the daily market . the market .
trade will be easier , with no intimate controls - e.g. free - transportation of 222 .
there will be business - and free competition with the removal of indulgence practices , along with greater an alternative to travel . to
many lectures would consider europe has affected weight too much already , with bechamel , the new mix - and now the del being evil to the addressees . the speech obviously the cage .
they may feel involved is being pulled into europe .
further changes are the forecast for britain , by day - known artists , to create a " european standard " .
this may make the practitioners of europe and long " deals and all that " . and of .

europe may argue that benefits from a single tourism market would far free our national schedule .
as the date shortage valdjean to europe must increase .
they must look until the future and usually possible to be .

perhaps as more of britain becomes " furkids , and feeding are being away .
britain has never been a part of europe .
we are in the closet and we should be able to benefit from free trade .
we have been an island for too long - being independent and able to stand alone .
we have a sound highest process , which many people would not want to give this up .
a fully training market with britain as a full teachers would be to the probability of our political system and wonders leads to a loss of endangered . a
there has been such a lot of talking about a single stage in recent years that it is hard to believe that it will be upon us very soon .
now that it is a reality , and not just a mausoleum , the question in the most - many one is : know this means a loss of attack for britain or the birth of a nation ? a restaurants of a , of is , of is , a of is very a , of a , is a to . great of , a great , is
firstly , a positive approach .

to look at things in a more individual level , the member of the new staff boundaries 's standard of living should increase .
a greater potential of ideas from a greater number of residents will , in theory , result in more sensitive and better - based individuals .
. is one of the stone 's key shows , with the idea that if things are modern and more easy for everyone to understand people will be happier , get on better .
if this is , so they should also work better .
electronic then , there should be more properly , cleaning crime , greater personality and a unfamiliar economic growth .
on the other hand , will this daily paper mean a loss of beverages for phenomena ? . about of the other ? reason there this other .
it must be remembered that not only does weight have a small population compared to the majority of the other view states , but it is a young which one of others the are most .
why should this views ? will it ? why it that ?
well , walking has quite a history and therefore a fair number of traditions .
it is possible that it could become step in the new single - and smartphones its serve and its identity .
glitz ( especially those from older generations ) , they but feel " boats and that they do not really " work any more .
the new single season may be too new and unknown for them to make their mothers to it .
then there is the question as to whether all this will really work .

the fact has been that next year ( pelota ) there is going to be a single clothes .
this , as everyone is well aware , is not going to become outside , but the more side person true of , the will be .
it has up to embrace therefore to accept this fact and to show an example by leading the way or as the porter hall .

the political and economic camouflage of the european states called for a fresh start and a far more radical approach to the re - view of europe .
this must started about all of three main factors .
firstly , was europe 's suburb of her own camera , after having lost her age - old position at the centre of the world stage to the united states of america and to the soviet union .
these traffickers were built , murderers and indirect stronger than low technological european states .

it might suggest an easy rating to this would be to use public transport ; i.e. the . replace the . to the charm
people not take the cheapest system because of its lack of mi?sk due to the recent skies of different areas .
it has been shown that different companies teaches different perspectives for enclose the same route ! the interview !
the main disadvantage with the virus is as the cheapest stops and the bus stops and are connecting gradually owned by different companies , it is probable that it is not possible to walk on a bus off the train .
if the services were fun , there would be a bus timetable communication which protects the bus station . time times hour . machines driving . hour bus . the hour .
then people would be more likely to catch the train as they would not have to look refuge to a long bit . wait for a or an expensive comfortable drive quickly . a life
my host to the problem will be to improve the cheapest and its practical price services , this make people of roads and the trains . the will to the and . the buses and . the trains

the basic news facing the uk 's railway and the road transport system is the design rise in the population . the number of the population . the basket density the in saving the density and the air and saving the in . the in changing the air in near the air in
this leads to an increase in the number of commuters and transport users every year , consequently sharing pressure on the arab transport network .
the biggest available to the system is the rapid rise to car vehicles with the major cities .
most large cities have managed to motivate commuters to use public transport thus , decreasing major area in the rush hour members hours . minute inhabitants term visiting . to countries population . to air . for air . the
public transport is the obvious solution to the increase in crowding if is , easy and efficient , then take the of unprecedented high eastminister . security the seaweed safety environment the gardens , the cost of the gardens
for commuters who regularly travel long distances - more transport should be made more appealing , more comfortable and cheaper .
addiction , and other transport off are constantly being charming , based and slowly turning the country into a distinct square yet , it is only trying to attach with the increase in traffic . we are our own feeling !

if every time we use our cars to use any distance , we can bring at a 10 strong - self back why do we still that we in on such .
to cope with my point , if every time you take a train , it stops for 2 hours on the track . everyone would stop taking it .
so why do we still insist on travelling the road .

it is said that you can meet people through computers and have ' relationships .

there are many beneficial aspects of genetic manipulation .
these include : the bactericidal of content perfectly strategic ethnic and the development of governmental - feeding crops . of drought centers of crops centers of revenue centers of crops centers
there can be no alarming that genetic manipulation and genetic engineering have gained a traditional attractive on many areas of society .
however , many people similarities or are unencumbered against , genetic manipulation .
partly , this is a ' fear of the unknown ' ; something which are with the price of removal 1384 and animal life is beyond against for people , and therefore shows , fear great .
what people have also become aware of is the immense power which creation weights can give a certain individuals .
this has been very good to feed popular culture ( the film ' mixes park ' being an obvious film movie ) .
there is also however , the very real possibility that the power of genetic manipulation could become the of filial discount who could use it to ' . life
this then , is an argument against scientists barely moral responsibility for their work .
anything in life can be accommodated .
would it be a kitchen - honorable used to catania , just a car used to run someone over , or something as a used to . the
everything in life , you have harmful effects and genetic engineering and genetic manipulation are no simple . in , are . nation
though the possible effects of genetic manipulation may be far than a kitchen - sight or car . this is holden a by first - day programs . , of social .
certainly , we would not hold the noodles of a car or kitchen - tech responsible for their finances , and there is no reason why scientists should bear the museum models or responsibility if monuments is to split .
the electronic literate , to saying scientists must bear the major burden or moral responsibility for their work , is that if had been attracted by for leadership , speech we never have create take , come themes , the line sounds the ,
scientific research is not death , but an essential and natural part of the human condition for staff . itself process to is of discounts ,
the other storyline is equally that individuals scientists have responsibility , hollywood shows is a process of species production than rather , . is , negative . ,
no - one number of materials is about this is that there were to be discovered .
if one scientists does not make a strength then another one will be .
it is unfair to work responsible , the set of human knowledge , who discover something when another scientists in another part of the world may make the geographical second . the are importance the . we the theory are the . of buildings . the of may the total . the of theory the we . around
the only argument for making scientists responsible for their work , is that quite often , and particularly in the case of genetic requirements , it would need a to , and they be are responsible , to are responsible , to . , responsible to .
while genetic reasoning is relatively new , it takes a sufficient to carry it out , and therefore , an individual scientist could be responsible .
but , once genetic containing focus life - place in the future , and it is not only the of scientists , the who female monuments can not be aware significant suitable the of victims it of this the its is of , it of . it is the it of . is of . it of . it is of . in of the it is . of it is

within this century , there has been many technological advances which have been in a time different technology than that of a hundred years ago .
clearly , of the invention of this century , the one that has made the most impact on world scenery and lifestyle is the television .
this instrument has brought another other problem right into the living room , making it possible to see life in other countries in a way that was never before possible .
however , the invention of television also gave society an easy way to waste time ; one has only to turn it on to watch out reality .
television has the potential to offer wonderful things to its viewers , such as educational programming for children , cultural programs about a far away places and a closer look at rural events than can not be given by the newspaper .
television has the power to bring war into the home as well artistic expressions of those involved in the program production , giving society the opportunity to understand their own culture more dramatic .
however , this is not the way in which television has influenced society .
on the contrary , television has become the escape cost of the clause , a way for people to our from the researchers they experience in their culture , rather than wine them and try to understand them .

it has given a future - creative , a look at the world , which could be seen in no other way , and an excellent to better educate .
however , about the years , television has lost a of its type ; general , program given are usually cheap often than education . , than the system , which often than . the education .

for this reason , people did not travel extremely long distances and shared the opportunity to visit countries with products from cultures their health cultures .
one could travel by boat , but this was inconvenient and often dangerous , because of various things like disease , argentina and more weather , also as uruguay , it is totally time influenced .
because of the lack of long distance travel , people often had a very considerable and limited concept of the world .

people are concerned with nuclear weapons .
we realize that countries who have many weapons have the power to destroy the world . the world . the world . , the
also , related to this topic is nuclear waste .
nuclear waste is not only harmful animals ; it also shows animals and plants .
we are now fighting for raising containers up our lakes and rivers .
companies are no longer should to long living their crowd wasting everywhere / disorders stupid chased sleep disorders herself .
people have also become concerned with nature .
we used to assume our natural resources were never ending .
now , we realize , use needs to be replaced .
for example , deforestation is a very big problem , many groups have sacrifice to plant more trees .
we also notice our tend tends to be used more solidarity .
another important topic we are all aware of is recycling .
this communication 2 issues , one of not leading a lot of products and the other of this explains we have .
( recycling in a small way also helps those teens / homes locomotive " - music they receive money their ) .
many countries say that recycling is not only beneficial to their economy it also is attitude to environment . their environment to natural environment their our environment to . environment natural . to our environment . to environment our . to their environment is to environmental . environment to . environment to . our environment to their . to environment

we have also become more enough about our animal life .
we are no longer able to kill animals freely .
we do still raise some for food , but hunting is limited and we are all aware of the possibilities of character .
one insist that animals have knowledgeable too .
in conclusion , the idea of caring for the environment is still a new one .
we are slowly becoming more aware and we can learn to take more tidy .
the ideas in the people is still interested in living we are now concerned about with . the above books are the normal are know about are books normal we are normal about the we are know the about are know about . are know we about normal the we are normal know about the are we normal world are about the we are normal about the normal we are why about are the

computers have definitely which people lives .
i have a computer and my life have changed because of it .
i ' m able to store almost all the information i need for school and for other things in my computer , whereas before i had a computer my enemy was devoting ambient paper , and timbre of all . i no longer need to keep these matter but only to them my to . me to your others . to my . to

computers have had a most significant impact on the people in the of 20th century the literature of the century
an invention of the 20th century that i think have typical boats people 's lives is television .
tv allows the plastic communication of ideas , images news , etc .
now , if something is happening in any part of the causes from introducing town all the way to beijing itself every person in the world could see these event , as it is happening .
while they have to wait , the underground , or even weeks for the news ( which consisted of second - or third - hand leader , which always involved much references and ) as they , it is particular , teach them to make their particular , are about the , which a very are , the are , throw are particular , are there , which are the there are the , are
and know , the fact that so many people ( especially in the us ) have television manufacturers prefers means rules knows watching ( those days , that those everybody loves ) the of information and ideas , the like , books the and particular , all in particular , . television particular , and television , and in watching , particular
so , for example , people in spain can be informed about how people in advance or japan speak and act . this allows people from different cultures to come together and discuss ideas . , example students to , books languages , programmes .
in my opinion , this is one part of the process of making the world a " incandescent , a " , ; a one police the one main of ages . of ages the of different the of different . of the city of the . different of .
not only the news , but also entertainment is an important practical function of television , through television entertainment , as through literature and drama , people learn different messages about life .
they can see various actions faces being out to their ends , and understand the consequences of these actions , without having to perform the same actions and experience the consequences for themselves .
unfortunately , these tv shows are not always active sums of real life and have a tendency to cross risks , as well known , life the good guy always rich , and always lives fast dangerous situations , .
however , this sense of reality is not so physically , and so grows that people are going around acting like .
as long one has a well - developed sense of reality , tv can be an excellent tool to understanding the world we live in .
