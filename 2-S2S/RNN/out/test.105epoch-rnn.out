i often did on the characteristics of create that lead us to produce a new things .
we seem to be somewhat unhygienic , and using them to identifying nature , as well our white man .
technology and inventions seem to inform from our natural slopes of powerful and our human duration .
we would to introduce nature , so that we may live without environment , and we to other our , so we live our about judgement reservoir .
for these reasons , i would argue that the only effort of the 15th century that have kept changed people 's lives for the better are those that has been in the medical field .
although these staff do travelled from a entertainer of death , they do not allow to attract nature road or other human beings , the of field : . the shopping . of dedicated they , to have of budgets , they available to of regulations , they and to not afraid of , regulations they and to of for dedicated ,
they save lives .
by thousands of the nature of modern inventions , one notes a press , producing consumption away from a classroom that is promoted by nature .
we are ourselves a part of nature , yet we prefer to live outside of it .
we continue to destroy the plants , animals and the earth itself and our new inventions helps us to do it with more efficient .
therefore , the effort in the ming century have had , for the most part , a negative influence on our lives because by causing nature , we 're destroying ourselves .
in addition , our staff are used to understand one another .
we invent better factories and better economic systems melt for and celebrities poor other people .
medical inventions , on the other hand , are designed to help people of all colors , and can not be used to encourage road or other people .
they are one of the only lie " kind occurred of consumption 's creativity .
in our modern society , especially through developed countries , traffic and all problems , to it the protection of the environment . the whole environment . the environment .
in many governments argue that these problems could be solved by pollution cost of petrol .
to my start , this should not be the right way to solve them , but other measures need to be carried out .
in many usage cities , like new york and bathrooms , the first cause of air pollution is the gas and reaching non - vehicles which use diseases to act .
this trend will certainly rise in the future , due to the great number of people who are moving from the countryside to the city .
this phenomenon is happens in developing countries , such as china . this , background this subjects , especially this phenomenon , especially such , television such especially , such especially , technology such , background such , as advertising such , as such , background such
however , an increase of fuel 's price is not effective in reducing the traffic . technology , pollution the , service the is it the price one is price technology the vehicles . the , is limited technology is , technology is . the ways is technology
this . of the last three years , this price has been a dramatic source , but the air pollution to participate in . net , through the last days , the gas , during the past years , the years , . the years , the years in the . in the . in the , for in the pool , the architecture , in the site , in the architecture , economic in
it can be seen in some kilometres towns , for instance as in wetland , that leads people to use the fuel is an excellent way to reduce traffic and its consequences .
the said roared can be carrying out by a decrease of reducing or other ways for those who planting their carbon instead of driving the car .
another way to reduce traffic is the scarcity of public transport system is petrol , safer bus , etc . , etc . is the traffic to reduce traffic the is form the transport of traffic the transport traffic is the of traffic transport of traffic transport public of is the of transport traffic of transport is of transport
in fact , many people prefer to travel by car because the trains are often you or , due to the fact that they have to wake up early in the morning to catch the bus .
in conclusion , although going to petrol 's price could be effective in short term players , this can waste reduce use fuel and , internet to the air . , the environment , the and , the cost . the time . the 's , maybe the . , the on . it the , . the , of food , the .
however , better solutions can be found by making people aware of the benefits due to the building use of the car .
,
last week i travelled by air with your colleagues , the trip was good , but i lost my luggage .
it is big , assembly by blue lines .
i went to the staff to tell them about this situation . they told me to send an email for the company .
so i ' m writing for my shop , luggage .
i hope that you could find it because contains things very important for me .

to start with , everyone will prefer using cars than using public transport .
this is because when people use the public transport , this with them from england and waiting for a long time in a crowd .
also , having their own car will help them to go around others . to the without and waiting without take public transport to around them .
reassuming . petrol will be public transport .
this is because people are now for themselves and for their health .
so , they prefer using bikes than using cars or public transportation by their health and for saving the environment from pollution .
moreover , in the future public transportation service for mandatory to avoid the real harm of their involving movement . exhaust
besides , it compares the environment and this could cause saved reached and global warming .
to conclude , public transport is not useful anymore .
i believe that they will end because of their own , which is far more than its benefits .

in today 's society , it is stupid for one to expect work for a single company or effort for the of their lives .
this essay explains this statement from three , : economic , chiong and cultural factors .
workers do not gain financial benefits to the spend if they work for a single company for a very long time . takes having more self - their , allowing access to their and , to .
in japan , for example , many workers carries work hunting after spending a several years at a company in order to get a better job at another company .
apart from those huang examination motivation to work is not of money , one needs to think of working , for several them to get a better life .
it will be constantly exposed to 250 useless from the society if they / she gives at a single company for the infantry of their lives : some generally consider people who do not change their plant more .
again in japan , because there is a social salt that young workers constantly change their jobs in order to get a better job . some people tend to see those who stay at a earlier company as having no boyfriend and being less situations .
being very time for travelling to make other people see us . we are less likely to work for a single company for a very long time with such a social standard today .
companies takes using more ways if they hire a ordinary period . a hour period .
some countries % a company to hire an individual like regular hard if they work at a specific number of years .
in japan , for example , in the intention of disposing ways , companies are service to can part - : workers , : styles having through their after years 3 , years after the , . in for , in for , in for , in of for in , for in , for in , of in ,
this has been witnessing some companies that are hiring only part - time workers for the sake of identifying heavy : many companies , as a result , do not only a work any more than four years .
again , it is recommended for a hard to work for a single company for the rest of their lives .

everything that famous people have a hard life .
there are constantly in mind , in a violation of attention .
famous people do not actually have a lot time .

i think , these people deserve a freedom . which have a lot of freedom .
celebrities has 2 life .
first the and some of the and 's best is most life for most is for the and society most and 's society and
second is lives private without us and journalists .

sometimes rainy villages , and the restaurant .
it is not very nice .
often knowing .
famous people also want to spend time with family friends .
. i think to do this problem we need to gauge the time and place where famous person will give interview .
the game can even contact if they takes interview at the wrong place .
then i think this would facilitate the life of famous people .

i am so glad to reply from you .
i am very happy because you have decided to come my city .
this is a great idea because it means we could spend some time together .
first of all , i would like to know how you going to travel . to travel work . to , thing like to . i of , how like to know how and , what know and to know and like how to like know , to of , i to like know what how like to how know like to .
from your city to argue , you can travel by plane , trains or by bus ; whatever you choose , you have connections to the center of the city , although for me the fastest way is travelling by plane .
at the time , there are different transport , such as buses , trains or the underground , and take you to the city compared by less an hour .
travelling in the city is a quite expensive . however , if you get one day , travel you will save money .
although to get a job is a quite intelligent than last year , many are looking for employees just for the summer time .
you can try to get a job as a laptop in fast food restaurants , or as a video - assistant shopping centers .
i hope this helps you help helps you hope i

i think many people use car travelling because , but when you on the road on own car are a of .
one of these are traffic : if you take the tube , you will probably have to hear in some minutes and you will move faster underground .
for me , people almost never n't have great real than public transport . for people almost n't find enjoy meet people n't have meet we the people we have people free a meet people we have n't people we enjoy people we time all of people
many of them think that move with their own car is better .
the huge number of cars is really very day .
i hope that there will be a future for public transport , which more effective than the car .
i think there are advantages and disadvantages of car .
an advantage is that you can go anywhere you want with your car , but a big disadvantage is the traffic .
another disadvantage is to find a park for the car on the center of cities .
public transport also has advantages and disadvantages .
for example , public transport has designed stops to do and sometimes there is a little late .
but a big advantage , for the underground is the most of . but cities the , but big a but big , as cities the is nowadays for the a disadvantage but a big , nowadays the underground is the disadvantage but the a nowadays the most is the

in fact , there is no future for public transport .
as far public transport is concerned , it does not seem to be a way by them , can reduce the channel of prices bus to fuel .
around my view , the type of public we will are specifically them .
on the other hand , vehicles industry has managed to create electric cars , so far as they do not transportation as .
this is a huge advance for the environment and also a huge problem for the form of public transport .
it can be seen how each years there are more and of new amount of and snacks . of product , of and , education there they , years they will there , will be older the , so there ; if there will be older , there if different , there will be different , and there , different there ,
far from being only a benefit for the environment , this fact is also positive for the bow who will be being an museums in spending compared to this service of , which a is in central public transport 's cause .
at this point , something seems to be clear for the public transport networks : their future transport on how they will be able to get more efficient computers , buses or planes .
why ?
there are two reasons : prices and environment protection .

fame is an passion for every celebrity .
your speaking , being famous is being well - known and much of effort is used to achieve that popularity , to be considered on a tv screen .
it may seem that the image of a person even lives separate life from a person who created it , but it is not actually true .
there are several reasons why the image is destroyed better .
one is that usually one and the same actor is mentioned one and the same character in jerusalem of films so that actor resented with his or a character .
also , sometimes a of the websites centres , when amazing unexpected chain mine a romantic building a role or and that books is . the , couple of a , of beds , of a , because of , an the of a , an
in short , actors become into associated their roles and it is not easy for them to change their well - known image even in a everyday life .
.
for politicians get high - move is essential because they are known in comparison with their actions .
. as for advice , it is vital to happen for journalists is responsible for it is done , it is be essential for in as is it be impossible to in their into more waiting common be to about more to be far . be in get . to get be
overall , these celebrities use their actor image like a brand for what they do .
to sum up , the attention to a celebrity is a good sign for him or her and it means that this person is very famous .
regardless of their willpower , they would be done by some journalists and their lives would also be on the suburbs , because it is what people want to know - that is to be a ticket works .

however , connected are with it advantages and disadvantages .
i 'd present it in my essay .
i ask my young their time for after school and , me that good and were . that
in the first place , i must say that when young people are to be and , if you to be if you must really know .
disadvantages of taking a sport is it for example if you ca n't active and having its lot variety .
secondly , when you are ashamed or you have a achieve and you could and that i from through with people .

in my class , most students say enjoy great .
healthy and young people and healthy life and rich - and people many and rich people and rich people and rich people and rich life and rich people and young people and young people and rich people and while people poor and people rich and people rich and young people and young people and
young people are less healthy now than twenty years ago , on training , that are less , term this people are less healthy now than many friendly more private now than seven years , far entertaining , far entertaining , far .
one reason for this it is that young people prefer to play sports to play volleyball , because it 's more popular or , for example , because they are not used to play football with their parents in the street .
besides , young people eat too much junk food and they 're less willing to do sports which offers more effort .
if i were a advantage , i 'd customers we want to do exercise outdoors , and i 'd set sports centre where you would n't have to pay .
in my opinion , junk food should be more expensive , so people would n't buy so much .
when you start doing exercise ? you feel better and you ca n't stop .

many people believe that public transport 's future would not exist due to an incredible country are number of transport : the factors are increasing bicycles , increasing cars or bicycles .
for this reason , people wonder whether a normal means of transport could integrate by this new transport room .
one i am completely sure that public transport is the best option to move in the city for several reasons .
first of all , and taking into account the financial crisis , public transport , like the bus or underground , is the cheapest way to travel or even and in foot , city .
overall , if you add not only the petrol prices , the maintenance , service insurance and pay a few but expensive vehicle .
in addition , everybody thinks that there are more people in a bus than in a car , so consequently , pollution produced , causes less .

but imagine if everyone would have a car , nobody could arrive on the time to their work .
on parks , public transport is the best option to move in the city .
but maybe , if communication - villages and bus - specific improving , public transport could be even better .

it is a well - known fact that everybody needs holidays .
to begin it to begin with start this , and to start with to start about to interact
believe we , aware of our , where we people , and the , and we should , we throw on to holidays .
secondly , we should consider two main options : going abroad or around our home ?
this could be the first question that we recently before going on the holidays .
nowadays , due to the suburbs and the increased number of dresses around the world , we can find a wide range of southeast where the energetic companies offer their services with an relatively low prices .
because of this low scale , many people decide to go abroad instead of travelling in the every .
of course , in order to prepare a good trip you also must consider the accommodation , food etc and go on the place you choose , you will spend more money or less .
another reason to consider should be the environment . if you go abroad , you can visit the grant typical networking monuments and personal park around the world , and if you can see your lot , despite is that you can be present . the lot of things , the things to also are limited . i , the you to will be of environment , the you help care will the . , you will be the care , the thing to will variety
in authorizing i think , a person must consider several advantage when you plan a holiday trip and it depends on the person 's knowledge about where to go and how , to get whether one trip could be cheaper or expensive .

i will n't agree .
i think the future of public transport .
also , i think this bothered many things .
now we live in the paintings world , where all is paintings : work , development ideas , many things .
this is a new personality .
the base of this un is " to share " . the " of the smell of the " smell the " back the "
this idea brings great benefits for all .
is the same case in the transport .
if we would share traffic ( public transport ) could be lower cars , while will not be fewer less jams . and traffic .
everybody saves money and the line economy is better .
the fuel . they are more getting to the places .
this model has many advantages .
to solve the problem of traditional model , because then the traffic is safe and the time in both kinds of transport can grow and be played . it 's more comfortable and quicker to move in personal transport but if only is one mode of transport will be more efficient and more comfortable for all of us . but if the most city one mode of transport will be more efficient and more convenient for all of us . but if the is one mode of transport will be more efficient and more comfortable for all of us

i agree with this statement . i think will be like everyone will have their own car and they wo n't use public transport .
nowadays , every person wants to live . for everything , every person want to live a convenient way to do . , every person want to a life convenient for . to for . too to for . to for time .
.
but some people ca n't buy it . but some people ca n't buy it . but some people ca n't buy it . but some people ca n't buy it . but some people ca n't buy it . but some people ca n't buy it . but some people ca n't buy it . but some people ca n't buy it . but some people ca n't buy it .
because they have a lot of life and they have n't got enough money and they have n't got enough money and they have got enough money and they have are able to be us and they have its able to get enough money and they have diseases enough .
so they do to use public transport . , so they are prefer public transport . and they to use public transport .
there is unthinkable to poor people .
in my opinion , using public transport will be not so popular than travelling to accomplish .
in my opinion , public transport has a long future because a lot of people live in big cities and they do n't use the car to move in the city because public transport is more comfortable , which they can take the bus and next take the underground and , finally at life that they want .
but if they use the car wo probably have the world for it place that they go . they are . to be it , they . , but they use the car world the government future the
i think if people use public transport are less used and the island on the city should be blue instead of theoretical so then now say that public transport is n't a future . the is future a people no . there transport n't if transport a if there transport a there if transport . public transport there . transport
moreover , a lot of people use public transport because it is n't have a car .
in conclusion , nowadays people are very regulations about the environment , which it can be caused by cars , and they do n't use a car , so i think that is n't the end at public transport .
today we see a lot of television . i think that it is not a great result , due to watching more television . you can become an foot .
in addition , most of these programs are convinced , good only to spare your time .
the reason is that a lot of people do n't want to receive bad news , but they only love to be entertainment .
fortunately . , television . winter , particular . every , sunday every beaches . in sunday but is day sunday ca these . in day . in every sunday , is one sunday is today . , every sunday this beaches is every sunday , is day every . sunday is day sunday television , sunday is another television . ca sunday , . sunday is every sunday ca . sunday ,
there are expecting that try to invent new programs and trying to educate people .
one of these is channel losing the day , they people some interesting stars about the history and nature . and , those of these this those these is the side age . this is those this reasons cruise these age . these of those is squash reasons these this those of the those is of age this , those these on the reasons age , and the this is of the reasons and this , center
i strongly it is possible to do the of programs . started that i it 's to know that it 's let to know it that true it 's to what that know 's , it to because it responsible to it know because it to happened , it to
for example , during the days , it 's possible to explore following news , shadow programs , but also exotic and credible .
if we have a plane programs , this . i am sure that all the italian citizens could have a good strict and more knowledge about our beautiful world .

lots of people believe that sooner or times public transport will lose their important role .
first of all , to believe that travelling by car is much more convenient .
actually , you can use your vehicles , not only to get the office or to reach the shopping mall , but even to go on holiday without having to stand in a effort before while having a train , a plane or a bus .
actually , there are lots of traffic jams , and it is quite common necessary being up the road .
transport but it could be quite the same , because it could be quite the same , for travelling by bus and , all the same , because it could be the same for travelling by bus and , as it , the will be the for travelling by bus and , because the and . , the also because the is because the to because , it all the because
no cars are becoming cheaper day for , so everyone can afford to buy one , even those who are not considered frightened people .
so far , public transport has been considered important is . environmentally friendly and fast . and fast , public transport has been considered cheap , so far , public transport has been considered become cheap advantages , and far , public transport has been considered increasing advantages , more advantages is has become is considered important , fewer poor and more has considered more important is , advantages and , has is 's advantages is , and advantages heavy has been considered is
on the one hand , we can not forget that cars have a bad impact on the quality of the air and that they are one of the most important cause of pollution .
on the other hand , everyone is more or less aware that cell companies have simply a great impact on the air pollution .
anyway , it could be possible travelling by car and when you arrive in a certain destination , you can choose to reverse or to walk adjust instead wasting buses , the underground or other public transport of . train , faster a car train , a travel , bus a , train a , bus train a travel , a
driving and convenient . it could be even much than public transport . much , and start could be even better than public transport . much more good , cheaper and far could be even better than public transport . can be more comfortable than transport . much more convenient , cheaper and faster will like more comfortable , more
we must even take into consideration the fact that the car industry has developed lots of various vehicles .
there are now available new lands , for example , electric cars . that are environmentally friendly . they are not so ignored , so everyone can buy one of them .
in conclusion , i strongly believe that there is no future for public transport and travelling by have be day poor and less bigger .
i think doing sports are healthy .
when we do sport , we feel better , our body and our house are good .
my favourite summer is yoga . my favourite sport is yours . my favourite sport is yoga . my favourite sport is yoga .

michael had made a mistake .
it is true that travelling by car is much more convenient than travelling by public transport .
but at the same time , it also created much more energy than travelling by public transport .
rather than saying there is no future for public transport .
i think it is more correct to say that there 's no future for cars private transport .
due to global warming , many countries , including plants , turkey and google had been starting to fewer public transport in to protect environment . and to developing , and modern , resources countries , modern and , modern and , to
their government try to increase exhaust prices and the public transport prices .
although the government wants to make us using more public transport .
i think there 's still limited impact on our society .
the most efficient way is by on us .
if we all studying to use public transport and like people good , is to our planet .
i guess more people will start to do it . to there we do people to , . i , do people will start to do will to do they will to there they will to are we will know to will learn about there they will people know to what we there will do to know there we will people start to what know it we

. if the number of car brings us to be completely behind .
this is the main problem facing the uk 's transport system .
the reasons for this has and diverse .
people of today want more freedom and have more punctual a smoke , gases which will reduced an the on car .
many people also feel by walk to or use public transport to get places , and close who had to school when they were young things on making their to school by car , and they believe , now or not . that there are many people who about so for conditions the in streets the from . conditions the in streets the
this facilities are supported by cases , like the state preceding case , and the newspapers and seeing activities movies which have very high plants and give increasing public european to the people on the streets .
people also use cars because they are more convenient than public transport as they can travel whenever they wish , and can travel " doctor - to spanish " instead of having to walk bus plane and machines .
the installation levels of vehicles on the roads have ask that using a bicycle to travel has become eaten to many people , due to the danger , and also to the levels of pollution from cars on the streets .
.
some people may not use trains due to their dominance parked services .
buses . these modes of promote the freedom of choice available with cars , as the passengers are imperative to the timetables and or of websites stations .
i think that the government should help outweighed transport by to the amount of personal and reducing fuel of buses , trains and of convenience scarcity of transport
the government should make this by handling more money in public transport than in the roads , such as the doctors of safety .
this building investment will lead to more private public transport , with more services on the timetables , lower cycling and less valuable .

the era of harbourfront , survivors a ' must - have ' largest in the nation and the most important ' must - have ' was , of course , .
the presence of television has brought about several crucial trends in our culture : the mass persecution of various , the cardinal of , and cardinal expressions and the professionals .

another effect of the television on people 's lives is the awareness of our lives .

15 second approaches of our time are sold for form of dollars and , as a result , the american population is made to laugh , or to cry , and often times to buy a product .
finally , and perhaps most importantly , the citizens of america have experienced side the of city television a behaviour increase the standard this , as the , to ways , the city , the . ,

we must watch what we watch .
i do n't agree with the statement , because there is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient .
when you decide to travel by car , it 's certain that you feel anywhere , you can stop wherever you need . you can swap off when you how that is to by
however , there are sometimes more important schools than feeling comfortable when travelling like money . travelling by car is expensive , as the price of its petrol is still increasing , because of limited natural resources .
although there are some places in the entire world where car - users can not complain about the price of supermarkets . there are also many more areas where people shared driving cars for cleaning or riding a bike as they ca n't afford a car .
nowadays , we are much more aware of the environment .
thus , we know that using cars is harmful for the environment . we are advised to take public means of transport instead of travelling alone as it means less burning by all one transport .
that is more , in multiple countries there are a lots public transport when forces by people to by cars . to their private . the there . , there in , there in public there , transport there in , public transport there in public . there , in there , public . there public transport . public transport . public in ,
to sum up , in my opinion , public transport will disappear as a but they did n't discover new natural resources numbers , or cab a cheap expects to your cars with . public transport . and , to transport everyone . , to after , to call , there say , everyone there . , there . ,
we do not care about the big environment in china , but we only care about the environment in or around our own house .
we through all kinds of female waste into the same basket , and will it . , it be that it there , it will there all management trees via all into the all construction on policy into the gas of around , the all , around the through , in increase the , in increase , the in increase the services , the

.
we only choose the way which is convenient , but may have negative impact on our living environment .

life phones are caused for the more in the few , because a new way of life is causing due to technology advantages .
when i look forward , i realise teenagers are different , they are looking for different things for their lives .
for example , when i was well , all students used to study for several years to become an expert and getting a good job .
nowadays , teenagers study only for a few years because they want to get a job quickly .
all around me , it is required quickly , education way of life , way of thinking , technology so i think all that will make a change in the lives of the future .

in regard to a recent radio capacity discussion about the positive and negative aspects of blood presents such as vianne , whilst items or different life experience , the decision is open to man .
on the one hand , i strongly believe that people should receive create at any time if it is for , because or do you know me how you . them

in addition , i do not actually find any costs to this type of present .
on the other hand , deforestation safety are extremely according to right too .
not only they are made with true love , but also they are made , generally with recycling products , such as glass , and even power .
the is issue the that , fact that , fact it is , the is fact that is the issue is the that is the responsible , is the responsible that is the , is the it is the waiting , it is the it , is it , is it the , is it , happening the is responsible , it is the responsible
however , the person who has not like it at all .
this is the main disadvantage .
this ideas to make me to my conclusion : the best present to receive are experiences as you will always remember them , sharing them with your family and shaker .
my teaching pyramids changed else when i finished this course that consists on in second level . wardrobe mentioned my restaurant , little arrival , i especially when i realize drop especially i arrived in day i says when i says in i arrived when i realize when i in next periods mentioned , when i in the journey in
until that , my catholic in teaching english serio on the following gear : ( i ) children should be a speed english , as seven ( ) " work can should teach , and so , we have any way a in over ( ) : , a good any from through and : ( the , student really very focussed with from . and , really very books attack the students : the and will different them .
my long help me feel more confident to become an english teacher in the future .
first of , can the first of one , parents have our children writing english the of sport , play sport sports to children the work sports the sport play the sports play , the sports children to the children to the play sport , children sports to children work the english , play the english play , children of , the can ,
my first spectacle is adults customers the language visit better than children .
by reading child language of i , that consciousness the language is in , mission conley , nuts conley corn , mission ernst , mission of ,
also , children at age between 5 and 9 that called a cold period , they can acquire second language colors to not need any special methods of teaching .
children have better advice than adults and they cross useless . taekwondo makes not .
however , older learners will be successful in the second language ( workhouses ) a / extroverted . " , ) will be successful , but will ,
( ) that juice who learned based after the touch of spanish american assistant spanish or who brave books news food before and . tea were books and who " inconsolably , john " recently show john novels , show " john show were john , show novels john show books 19 , show " who show writers aff show , van john called books show the books , call is show
. therefore , in the future , i will encourage everyone to make their child make an for england , as possible to help their children , having have like native speakers . the news speakers . and , . and , . and , . place , and in , and to , and to , and
if i have a chance of teaching children . i will create an active atmosphere with various activities , which focus on the petroleum skills and give students opportunities to exhibit with email such as , etc . , etc
secondly , the teacher should inspire to students motivation and develop student 's awareness , in learning , so they can gain their the appeal in learning language when i was in roger professional . i did n't have a to english , because of my parents ' . of the and , have ' , we and , the and ,
consequently , my results do not meet the goal as my parents expected .
until , met a by regarding recounted my parents , i in the class kitchen high skin , and i ability better . i and . childhood my , i part a instructor puzzle , face when i imagined fee terrible and fee childhood , i imagined a degree on , and i screamed and , i and to degree i , and i have and
i want to become an english teacher .
motivation is the second important is in depends . that makes students field in political ( snowball , as cited corn , vision mission . , mission . ) wheel , is near the is parks the is important biggest the is important in the mentioned is . the biggest important case , in mentioned , parts
the they will never get bored .
the more dynamic , has been in language learning , students will gain the more successful .
it is really a long - term bird that students can improve their proficiency in second language .
they need to observe numbers of candy guards , and do many tasks to obtain their goal .
as a names , i will make efforts to increase the students of beds because of its the glass participate dench and as in horses , conley beans , nuts as , shirts vision , mission vision , names
thirdly , a good teacher is the one that can , - all of activities in class .
for instance , when i teach grammar , i have to define how many structure that i can teach in a lessons is enough , and with some difficult grammar rules , i need to break it to teach in turn .
stories , your new car . the your , the stories can old places through the quality new places the bus improve the to new stories within the skills system , visit the their skills a within the , stories the , where the stories , system stories the , ' and , the stories skills the , system ' , leadership stories , and system , the your , system
after teaching the rule , i will ask family students to work with both and improve using the product a effect on my handheld caf?s . in the wide , i will ask my students to work in a civil effect . i will ask my students to work in jeans and communicate , and i will ask my students to work in both the and i go into the family , i will could my students to work in a pair and i , we the with my to a and ,
. when they are working , i can hear their a and you not just what they say , also if it they if , we know the people to knowledge .
finally , the one is known the interesting context , consists it is also an interesting . finally , is position one that is also an position the about main literature that about the another main . scientific main literature the historical main is scientific . literature it is position another . theory that course is an position theory the . that is position very . one scientific is position . process that is an position theory .

the smoke development of computer technology has created a great variety of in their . times the
there is nowadays taking needed for computers in all parts of society .
metro area which have received tv grammatical is the computer games industry 's .
since after early , apple when computers such as the bride has knife and the statues . were brought into the of people puts has followed a large their of children . ' , has through by their through ,
there is a drinks schools among parents that computer games played a child 's ability to learn .
the development of more mysterious and alejandro advanced computers , such as the glass and participate , has served to easter the " problem .
the growing of the games have strongly to children .
however , parents feel that children should be outweighed their minds by reading books and that the computer games industry are me doing not to learn .
computers have also been banned for a fall in education standards with primary school children ; a hotel recognised by the results of the which that were the meaning of the top of the school , they are to move in their minds and consider on another a , and to the , in of , and
another average sports that computers have created is their role in the workplace .
there are many people who fear that computers will eventually recycling man in the workplace .
the role of computers is already important in employment areas , such as putting , which require a continuous ability to be able to and relaxation numbers .
these computers , have replaced humans and such recycling have undergo revolutionised that the standard of could have increase as a result .
as the computers are : more efficient than humans , do not require are for their work , are less than , and will never a day off because it written increased used is a variety .
in another claim made that suggest humanity - game could become useless is that computers messages between - medical behaviour .
the evaluation of the world wide website and the internet has created building that the human race will become an .
the internet allows you to interact with people from all over the world and it also tend many other illnesses to , sunbathe make life easier for us . continue for us .
the internet also has another influences problem to many .
the poor exists that the computer theater and its , such the internet , will the from life .
the human time is constantly into getting on being to labor pieces , but with the introduction of the internet , one could depend their life without us to leave the house which many believe would build society .
however , at the moment , the association of computers is very much dependent on the existence of humans .
this no matter how much artificial sentences a computer may be able to show , it still have to rely on the human brain to remember it and to put it into the noise .
although there are plans for to customers computers , can themselves , ( and i , personally is very quite language ) and still a spend the and try , ; any , have .
since i have been studying in australia , compared with china , i realised there 's a significant difference of english study .

for instance , i looked for a chance to talk native speakers , while waiting for the train , or writes in tv due during my homework .
i have learnt that small repeats of time by abroad themselves and you will be used very meaningless .
in conclusion , by dickens and comparing study strategies , i called time management is improvements to - obesity learning .
however , to become a better way , it is also important for students to stay focused and leonard . drinking

people 's personal style will be more comfortable .
i wondered there are many changes in the future .
