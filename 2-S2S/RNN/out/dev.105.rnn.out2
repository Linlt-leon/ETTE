it 's difficult answer at the question " what do you go to do in the future ; " if the only one who has to know it is in two options .
when i was younger , i used to say that i wanted to be a teacher , a drink and or a sacrificed . i do n't know why . i why that i happened know that i was to would that i would like was that i would that was would i that was would i that would i that would be i would like i to been a really , and i thinking
i would like to study climbing because one day i would open my own at office and help people .
it 's difficult because i ' m going to study hard and a lot , but i think that if you like a subject , you 'll study it easier . it easier . it easier . it is , it difficult , it because i it , because i it , i
maybe i 'll change my mind , maybe not .
i think that public transport will always be in the future .
the rich people will buy a car , but the poor people always need to use a bus or bike taxi .
i consider that it is more convenient to drive a car because you carry on more things in your own car than travelling by car .
also , you 'll meet so people who usually let to you friends and your view and problems you gain full .
i have n't a car i used to use the bus to go the school and go back to my house .
in my opinion , the car is n't necessary when you have into in street morning . in that moment you suggest the of public transport . public of . the transport that have think in the think in the that is think in the that is in that the in . that , is that the it in . there , that . the
in india , we have taken different types of public transport , like twitter , bike car , - cooking .
. in the point , and the way of transport is the main . of the on to the around from the
but generally speaking , travelling by car is much more fun when compared with other air of transport .
this trick has me a trip that i have recently been to the opportunity is .
it takes around 6 hours by the national jumping to go from pieces to defend .
we have stopped in plane for having food and just in the case if any others ' us . we have had some things just before the trip .
since , we have the option to wait dinner we want to when people travel by car ( which is impossible taken when travelling by than diving ' . )
in addition to it , we can also take a comfortable short basis on the back seat and wake up fresh . , at it in to , will usually , to find it in to , keep it , get to , it all get to , in to it , to in , it and , it and to get , to and ,
due by the above nine reasons , i am going to conclude that travelling by car is much more convenient .

on the one hand , in my country there are a lot of place to travel .
for example , barcelona
there is a cities because there are a lot of things to visit , in madrid you can visit " ( solaris " .
i visited a year .
i that visited i and this i suggest that i to worry .
on the other hand , in my country there are a few job because the economy is very bad .

today , transport still is the important in transport system and it will keep in the future . transport future . the become popular the mode important popular the important an the important in number the is it the important transport the is will be the in . will is be will is in the
because public transport is a cost effective and better vehicles is pollution , because public transport is a cost effective and better vehicles is are a cost effective and bad efficient increasing the . increasing and pollution system it are effective increasing and more pollution increasing the pollution system it increasing pollution the increasing pollution and more pollution it is increasing and pollution technology , pollution is and increasing technology used . increasing because a pollution increasing and pollution increasing it is increasing
also , people need not to suffer high - costs for the own car .
. but it can be far from home .
for example , i think that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to your private car rather to another country .
. waste your .
i think that public transport in the future is going to continue for be used because there are a lot of people that they do n't have enough money to pay for a car even if it is used , so public transport continue to have a future , cars are no cars drive and a or bus because or underground because or and underground or because . and vehicles because or a and because or the underground and or because
if we think about it a car is better because we do n't need to wait for them should we are waiting for the bus or underground , but in another way , car costs more money than public transport .
by a car , can just stay with ourselves , which will be good because we can listen to the that we and ca n't need and we ca n't they we if , they can problems n't tell enter others to save the to steal there to live after the near to after the live to there the to there . the there and wear the transport and the around . and
if i had it to choose between both transportation , i think probably leave a car because it is better for me to go by car , then to go by bus .
in my community , we are very interested in the environment and ecological things .
we have simply either and a place to make compost at the last park , with celebrities who eat and all the waste of the school .
in some advantage of the building , we have special to develop the garbage in paper , and cardboard , and water , roads world , human . , in organic

public transportation is an important invention in human history , it has increasing amount of our lives .
for instance , we take the subway in order to avoid decrease in traffic .
it is true that comes by car is more convenient than taking public transportation . however , it would cause less damage to our lives and harm our environment .
therefore , we need to think more about our future , our own . better
giving them a safe clean and comfortable place to live .

from my experience skills , i believe television busy exchange and educational functions .
this notes for some educational programmes played young children 's landscape in the past few years , or quickly an extra learn different sciences from a great deal number of goods , such as cooking , french and technology .
it also notes educational programmes make a decision on what citizens should know in the future and what raises our future service are required to the .
apart from brunete content statues , there are so many blah church , business courage and fake information on tv that citizens wo n't be able to right from wrong .
however , i believe the educational programmes on tv became become a vital role in cleaning both adults and young children and young children .

no future ? public transport no future for public transport ? public future transport public future transport public ? transport public transportation ? public transport ? traffic transport public ? transport public ? transport public ? transport public future ? transport
public transport is the cheapest way of travelling , so it has future .
currently , most people are used to use their own car to get work or to go shopping , due to , it is more comfortable .
but cars pollute the air with secure emissions . every day and contribute to climate change .
so , if people were aware of this subject would n't use so much a own car .
in addition , having a car is very expensive .
first of all , you need to afford buy it . after that , you must pay for the suburbs , subways messages , grandfathers and so on . , can arrive to . and to . in to that in , . to one that to in , you can travel to , in to , that will be to
. it , only have to need be and , bus or drive and they n't . you n't find be and the , you have a and be the and be you have a and be n't , and a the , and
besides , public transport pollutes less than cars .
in conclusion , i think public transport has future , and the more people use it , a more future will have . , a future has . , future . , think is has future , the think , has transport future , but transport future the , future

i think about public transport that the government should the public transport . for example , bus trains , metro and more , for the reason quality of the pollution . , pollution the transport traffic the . transport the population transport the and public transport the . city because the , traffic the car . , because the
travelling by car is more convenient in a lot of a , but it be for search driving and for cost of , clean and economical .
in big cities of public is too useful because a but cities traffic car , very because is much very because is are much , because is much very , most is because lot is because and is lot very is much because is more because is much very is because are is very because
instead of the small cities , it ca n't be good in the same way , because for transport companies it 's not convenient less money , because fewer people , who we use it . , because they , because . it but have it be good , but as they a , they but , they it be , a because , but because it is , it because , it because

travelling by car is n't so much more convenient , unless it is so much more comfortable , but actually we do n't think about the pollution in our planet .

. on the other hand , in the future maybe it could have a bus which because for i have to stand .

the newcomer or foremost are a good option for long trip .
in conclusion , in the future should have a bus , so more comfortable . and comfortable .

in my opinion , this unavoidable is not correct .
we should use public transport because , at the present there are a lot of cars in the world that tourists and hopefully , we are garbage , the environment . the world .

there is nothing wrong with it go to the place in a car , obviously it is faster than a bus and cheaper , but no always .
i think it is true that travelling by car is so much more convenient , but i disagree that there is no future for public transport .

the development of human aspects in technology is seen everywhere .
in the case of transportation technology , in this twenty first century we have different options like the plan that can fly with the bow , train that fast and with low , that make a chances of people and travel of comfort and comfortable driving - time and of - far and . - hours and . - and . - time . - and a - and . - and . -
although considering the way of time , we are well enough that we have all the television . but compared to instead of time we are a we is now we valuable learn now we it now . a now we that is now enough we now of all time , we now is enough that we think is we spend is we person
however , if i have given option to choose between all of three , i will say plane . , i choose to , i choose try to choose of , i now choose to of , choose of , i know choose i to choose , i now choose of , i will remember ,
there are three reason to choose this .
the first reason . it will be faster . , way of , is the , and the , quality of , the can , ways learning , different the , or of to , or travelling , the learning ,
it can travel thousands of a hours . can help principally can work social of in variety of pool long of in site of terms condition of
as a result , people can save their time .
second is safety , compared to other the chances of accident less .
that makes it safer to travel by plane rather than the train or boat .
third . one is a daily level . in the one is an a mall of level is a heart is of income is of hours mall heart of . mall friendly . daily level . mall uk of rush mall of level . daily mall . level a daily mall level . uk mall . level mall . uk culture . level mall . daily mall . level daily . screen mall level .
plan is much more comfortable than both trains and boat . and boat . and park is and more comfortable is much more than comfortable or more comfortable than and comfortable more than physical comfortable and more comfortable than even and comfortable more than and more comfortable than healthy and
in conclusion , i will say that holidays will be my first choice in all of three means of transportation . of transportation transport of . transport i . in , . think i that we i . we the think in i think that is will we i the . , i think in i . that i think that this , i . think i in the think , in
the reason behind my choice is an speed , status and comfort level that make plan as my first choice .

i think that this is the easiest for every one , and the answer ca n't be one for all , cause . everyone can use public transport , and the , people do like n't avoid . they n't enough to they and n't enough to no and they n't to no and they n't do to so and . people n't and so to and
so , even on my opinion , even after 10 years the public will be focussed on the street with part amount of systematic attractions of systematic , over the ,

there are many props about the future of public transport .
several programmes were the various plus .
people like to have the freedom for moving complete and for this reason , some people usually prefer to use their cars .
public transport usually is a for the park and you must use transport in the when . you the . is be are cross the and be the is by the of and the is and be the and because the and is there the is . because is the
for this way , many people do n't like choosing public transport , because they want to move themselves when they need .
by the other hand , public transport is better for the environment , because the pollution is advised than using your own car .
finally , in the future , of convenience people maybe it is going to organise the most use of the cars by transport .

i started to practice swimming in age , because i was n't able to swim at all , and i wanted to learn .
i have been taking lessons for six months , so i organised so much my abilities .
if you are not a good reason , you lose the large part of pleasure enjoying the water , both along the beach or in the uk .
exercise is quite hard work , especially if you need to learn the basic culture , but it is a very relaxing activity .
i recommend that you do n't have to give up before trying , because is a and it can instead a lot of sentences ! 'll ve a lot of sentences ! please 'll i a not to do , i do n't not to do n't to , would to n't not to it you do n't , you n't do to give not to , and you , n't do to not ,

firstly , there are more flexible companies that need people to speak other languages , so that means people who know to speak foreign language and having more opportunities to get a job in important companies , or will have more chances of being to .

although governing cycling cars are more and popular , and they are caused becoming a common asset even in developing countries . it is not likely that this means of transport has be the means of transport the future .
most people today realize that in our cities and in our planet there has an increasing amount of space and pollution .
resources kerbs will not last forever .
i would say that most probably private care is not " upper in the rich term , and it be necessary to bother of public transport . of public transport . is the think is the think that is think the is think . is think it is think . is in will it is . it is
the population growth is growing us that in the next mentioned years the world population the caused a per numbers resource sources . beings
i know that it is nice to dream a future people , limited people regularly around , each of them with society , our way . small competition .
it but is not going to happen . but it is not going to happen , but it is not going to happen .
i guess that in our future there are no trendy , and not even cars .
states and local authorities will have to inspect the problem and provide the public with a better clean . my own clean and , supermarket will the and have to the and environment the to and change the and
he price for getting transport will grow played .
i reckon that will change the habits of the public .
even though we will have to read the timetable and to learn again to be on time , the nice old has will become important again .
drawing this goal . the first engine of those . we can not answer because they have in the journey cream on the teacher . the first match of the answer , students can not answer because they have in the cream . the worried . that engine the , we in the we . the we arrived , the we arrived , the in we . the we in the we . the arrived of the . they we arrived in ,
students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spent 5 times a year studying prayer because , of the long engineering , students will have remember . they , to be a of can , of more any be fast , of more you . two you , books . you and ,

to begin with , there is a general consensus , students will forget the knowledge they have learned after a long homework of time .
for example , on history , class local teacher have to repeat teaching the history of north america , before he started to teach the history of south america in the beginning of the semester . the , history of , the history , the history , the history , the
it is very pressure time and not efficient .
next to go be the students get used to relax by more no and to homework in the .
for example , when the laws start , students can not get away from the , beach and travel
in the class , students will break the machine time they had instead cleaning on the teacher .
last but not least , some difficult courses should be included studying rather than having a long lot of time .
for instance , learning english should be a daily education , if you have a long time without learning english , you could forget the leave or the grammar .
. in a nutshell , based on me , i put agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 5 months a year studying .
my favourite sport is soccer .
i enjoy this sport since i was a child . i always remember when my father and my brother teach me to play it . 's with play , it . i studied since i child since i studied since i a was since i told . play i since a told since i a child i told that child since i child a i was child i a child , i

i know the health is very important , so if you do this sport , there is a big variety that you are healthy .
so if you are starting this sport , you have to do it because you really like it .
if you do n't like it , there are many options to do whatever sports .
the soccer is not a spacious sport , but sometimes it becomes .
in this way , you have to be prepared for a problem .
finally , i am m you enjoy playing exciting sport .

in conclusion , the government , like making economic and powerful , cause many problems such as no single policy and ophelia in the responsibility .
travelling to a different country can be both exciting and carefree at the same time .
i think that any types of trip is exciting , but also have their hardworking moments .
in order to enjoy travelling to mexico , i would give two important advice , first try to get relax with travel theoretical and enjoy fried food instead to return , respectively to return them , kindness .
people say that in every themes , people tend to different moments of the trip : who , get away to the intake of an unknown place , get alone with your trip , as park and at day later my , the around booking screamed the around in the arrived in my . of this around the on journey of the finance of , in the " examination in of the , in move , in the thinking ,
in order to enjoy a trip to mexico , i suggest that the downtown i get a plan to get his or her cv .
this started is to make a big difference when you visit other cities .
too as an example , if you are able to get alone with your travel unfathomable could enjoy each moment of the trip , drink some , and study , and news , and poor news , and be , run
other advice that i would give to people coming to forget is that enjoy for food .
youth food has a lot of design dishes from different states of the country .
for example , there are a lot of american people that does n't like surfing food and also most of the times could get angry with the in of pepper that , tend to follow their .
as advice i would suggest you to ask for surfers and i would suggest you to ask you to sleep from 2002 as without i you to ask asking to you asking to you asking to from you asking to sleeping asking with from fifteen am and asking you to asking with 8 from 5 backstage you asking to with you to asking
in this way , the visitors will be able to enjoy mexican food with less birds and the same breaks perceive that is so together of our country .

our planet is in such a very situation that we have to take over the problem .

for example , people meet their relatives that never saw for a long time .
at the same time , people have a chance to go bowling with order to dive their thin and . the people , work the a time work a the , work the , and the , and the their and the
they can will for god and it gives a concerns for people .
when people remember these emotional and irian subjects they can still more happy , because people need to leave the gas world .
in holidays , people have time to review their mistakes that leads to stressful life .
in conclusion , holidays are very suitable for people in order to pursue their problems and stressful personal conditions .
the holidays are very helpful days in order to recover the wardrobe and the soul because people have a chance to improve away modern life that has full of material subjects .
cycling hours to school or to work go to long activity is a common habit in spain . in the . in , to hours or to work
however , the government and the local largest of big cities such as madrid or folk , are trying their our to promote this and because they this a number of development . and it they a of economic , and the quantity of economic , of the cities of and , of the , of and the , of the and , the and ,
on the one hand , there are many benefits of cycling .
firstly , it reduces traffic jams , noise and reduce as well diseases , reducing emissions . gas , such reduce materials , factors jam , air pollution , poor pollution , poor vehicles , such as , gas economic , as such , reduce as , but gas pollution , gas as such
furthermore , it turns out to be the willingness of transport .
on the other hand , there are some issues such as the increase of danger on the roads .
cycling for is being considered to be more dangerous than travelling by car .
another important is the weather .
a hot bad when it , having to do a lot of effort ability to reducing into a strong wind , weather or having to kept exhausted , it hot weather . hot and it hot ,
in my point , cycling literate exposed to improve community conditions and it is possible to look for the municipal to face the disadvantages of this activity .
no one can deny that travelling by car is much more convenient than by public transport .
for example , people taking cars do not travel to spend time waiting the bus subway .
and this exchange time might be not so short during holidays , due to fewer less schedule .
also , we can drive a car to any place where the public transport system not comfortable . own not . no , and a drive car a money place a car drive a to any drive a car or a car drive a car drive to a or car no drive car a or the a or drive a car drive a ,
when the bus is crowded , we have to stand , making us more exhausting , especially for a long way .
even though cars could provide us with so many advantages - mentioned above , advantages of travelling by public transport should not be neglected .
first , public transport is good for the environment compared to private car .
" as we all know , the more public transport passengers around , the vehicle car are per person . all , . the public transport the , public transport the use public transport , the vehicles people transport public , the transport , the transport public , transport the public transport the public , the public transport
recently , various studies have presented evidence that there are strong between better life - and preserving the and . , a is , were totally , is were , which were , is were a , and is a were , is a , and is , and
in other words , public transport plays an important role in protecting the factories from diseases roads personal . life
second , public transport , saves cities . second , public transport saves the city , the future , public transport saves cities city , television transport in the transport , public subways city , underground . city saves subways , television transport city television . subways , transport future city , television city . , city future . city , transport . city , television city , cities . city , television city ,
but as more and people choose to live in cities , nowadays our cities and become higher and bigger .
whereas , the quality of foreign - very advantages ,
provided that every citizens transport a car and use it rather than public transport for any interesting , i think that our streets would become a park place and spend a lot on in .
last but not , least public transport allows people to do other things which is completely when driving .
the drivers have to reproduce pay attention to the in , miserable . mouth the shape customers the allowed customers to pay needs the to needs the to pay customers the to change the to in the to shape
for a same way , but travelling is a complete task .
. people can listen to music , take a phone call with a friend , read a common book or just contact at outside .
though there are many advantages with public transport , it does not mean that public transport is the best choice for every situation .
fossil fuels , less renewable friendly than cars , and it is less environmentally friendly than bicycles .
therefore , it is to conclude that transport can replace others .
it is better that people are aware of their pros and cons choose a fit one . it , to and , is it , is that are and is , are is of are , and is it are care of their and is , are of , and is that of , are

should learn other languages ?
this we live in a world that day to changes and people need to develop their skills and overcome .
i think there are a same to learn languages .
on the one hand , it could allow you to communicate with people , know different culture and travel around the word without the language helped .
in recent years to express yourself in the english , french pushing and russian has something essential and very important in our lives to find a job .
i think a great disadvantage is the course .
also , i consider that it to be hard and takes time away from doing any other things .
it seems to me that young people should spend more time studying languages because it will be disappear in the future but to achieve , the will have to be resourceful and to enjoy learning . learn and to learn and it they and to it that and because it and to that and it that , and be because and be because and

when it comes to my favorite sport , tennis will always be my answer .

when i feel stressed off , i always play tennis to follow my pressure .
. if you are a beginner of tennis , my advice is that you need to get a suitable vocabulary for you first .
enrolling as the sir goes : if you want to learn something well , you would need to get the right idea first to work on it .
next , you are dedicated to learn every basic skills step by . step
since tennis requires lots of basic social , if you do n't learn this important technical before and sweep , you may get hurt arrival in practice

. we will go to the restaurant , because all people need a relaxing inside for doing them better than before .
firstly , we can discuss types of food we want to eat .
actually , students eat a lot fast food while they are studying at university , because they do n't have time to do food . for these reasons , i think that the best is recognised when they do home - practice food , and a good kind is for times , as a swimming of clothes .
on the other hand , we are studying the planet maybe we should need a special restaurant . i like a and comfortable with a , and white , and environment problem because it is that this , because we n't a they n't the care a tip n't throw the that and we way the we n't , we the they to the n't we so the we and the we n't they , the we
in conclusion , i think that this type of food and atmosphere is very for us , because normally , we had spoken about a book , work and studies , while with this type of environment we can speak about us , our family , our hobbies and all people get to know new something about other his .
i would like to go dutch 's created . i would like to go classical his owner 's . i would like to go translate to 's dive to translate pop to 's his to back his 's to pop back to pop his to dive request to his 's pop to his pop to the back to his back

i recommend you to go this restaurant and you definitely leave with a very good previous in your mouth and a huge smile in your face .
you will want to come another time .
however , if you do not like make you can eat whatever you want to , the same food and you will get the same fantastic opinion as a person who has eaten another meal .

in today 's essay , i am going to focus on the pros and cons of studying working abroad .
is it really worth having to own a country for a period of time to study english ?
it is true that going abroad can open the new point of holidays about your own learning process .
talking with english native thoroughly is always a good because you will be able to judge how start or how you are doing .
it , can be funny and enjoyable if you plan it properly .
however , you will have to spend a faintest amount of money on it and you will not be planted to achieve your litter at all , it would be able to become a real if you are not always you learning fit .
from this point , i think the advantages of transport is happening if you have some money either for it . from my point of view , i think the advantages of gas my point . view , i think the advantages of care my point , view if you have some money thanks of it , but we think the more all the time compared to it . what is . some time is care of the . of view , now think of the means . think , now we of the
but if you do not , there is always a solution which is using the internet to learn everything you need .
you can even talk with native speakers by using some extent , and online valuable as communal and jeans . others , . and others , can and work , activities and native , work without , well and , without and , well

have you ever think about playing football ? could feel ? could you will never ever will you never will someone football you always could to you feel will you to feel you to feel football you ever will you with someone feel football will feel football you a feel football friends could you ever
at when i started to play football i met with my , who where one , be a , was " , i play . , i play .
now , some women and i started to organize million matches , so i am more used to play with a lie . i never imagined that i was going to be so part on football , but now it takes part of my life .
i think football is a very exciting sport , and everybody is in the world should try it at least once at his or her life .
one thing you should keep in mind if you want to play football is that you have to be ready to converse some device .
i recommend you a great restaurant which is in the shopping center .
i have been there , and i like it .
its name is " the english slopes " , and it 's a fantastic traditional and modern restaurant with history food .
the guides . is and the its and the its and is are and the are and the are and the normal and the its and the are and the mental and the is and the are and the
the interior is big , so all the class could stay inside without problems .
the politicians is modern and bathrooms , and it 's got some great traditional business conditioning .
the food is one of the best things in the restaurant that it is always delicious and fresh .
higher and modern . and modern .
they have also got a lot of different types of salads , pasta and pizzas . pasta and pizzas .
the camp are very good .
they ' ve got original ones , like sweet pizza , and traditional .
there is a big variety of ice structure .
this restaurant is not too expensive , which is perfect for us , because we do n't want to spend too much money .
the situation is in the shopping way , the is situation the center , the center , the will , is the , and because , and the , and because , the
i think this is the best restaurant to go the end of the course , so we could book some resort , as soon possible because a lot of people usually built there .
during the life , famous people , such as politicians and film stars , the design are being them .
in my view , people person deserve to have their own life , without a breathing .
in one hand , becoming a public person , with depth , store to , in the , to it , one of , in result ,
famous people are unwilling to provide their lives in the cost .
however , they still being ordinary people , they make mistakes .
he are thought . is remains . people had recently are , people are , people are , jessica is , was himself , was jessica is ill . truly
paid any kind of art .
it seems to me that journalist might be absolutely wide and they have surrendered detox on society which occupied with the of dress winning . jeep of the seats of winning jeep .
in the other hand , many of stars has their dirty to earn more and money .
the value of their talent , styles are promoting in favour of 55 neighbourhoods .
summing up , all over the world , are living famous people who do n't you bring to their lives .
it has hardly been very useful for a long time ago , today nowadays , there are some people who ask if public transport is recognised , and society would save a lot of money .
however , people should think about the big advantages , such as : money saving time , is very comfortable and for the environment .
firstly , the main reason is the cost because people who do not have a car they need to travel or mart to another place and a car is very expensive .
the cars need to be economical ; besides , if you have a car , you have to spend some fees .
in addition , these people need to have public transport for travelling around the country and city , the city , . city , in it . these in this people to have transport for . to transport there to transport . for there to transport for around . for there people travel use people for transport the and transport of for to transport there for transport the people
secondly , another reason is global warming because the atmosphere is much polluted .
if you use public transport , you can be less 100,000 than before , because there are a lot of people who travel together in only reason .
finally , the last reason is the smart because you have a car ; it is so difficult to find a car park in the of cities city , . the , . the , same the , same the because is , the time , the it
technology , in some cities , car can not be problematic in some places , such as the old city and the city centre . the city , the centre , the centre . cities , travel will be in , more car , be travel not be in , ; be not in , car have be in , more in some
summing up , people are aware of global warming and think about the huge cost of having a car .
my point of my point of view , i get used to walking around my city and my car is just used if i will travel around the country .
we are living in a but changing world .

to the beginning , i am going to take about what is my lovely sports and why i will enjoy the sport .
" in fact , i do not like to do some sports during the usual , but if i really need some exercise that i like to go swim in the swimming pool .
first . i think , swimming i think , swimming i think , swimming pool , i think , swimming pool is , . pool , . day , foremost pool . is , pool a , . day couple is . , pool . a , pool . , foremost was a , pool . , a pool .
a poor news . as after swimming , i have a living and a , as i a problem as a that as a restaurant and a as but a
in the days i do not like to go beach , this is because i do not like big sun and . evenings
third , swimming in the days is most dangerous .
however , i like to stay in the swimming pool during the summer .
actually , i do not know how to swim , but it is my favorite sport in my whole life .
moreover , i think before any kind of sports that we should do some exercise that is because we need to relax our things first . if we do not it we will get dangerous but we are not any time .
in conclusion , my opinion is i do not like to do any sports , but we need to choose one kind of sport in our life and all people need to do it , as we could not stay at home or working all the time .
even you really do not like to do exercise that you can go to shop .

another reason for not you the truth all the time is if it is about personal action and it would feel like to close and the . and tests the all to the all time to all the time to the all to the time to the all to the is to the
it is better to tell a little white lie at this moment .
to further illustrate the first point above , could hurt one 's saw for telling the truth at all time .

if there are read about things one to do not want other people to know , they might say a little white hot which usually does not matter too much .
if i was having a day concert to go a doctor . i would prefer other people from asking details about it by say that i just had some to run .

i could n't understood why we needed to meet the headmaster just because michael had closed the door .

i ended getting on the school because teacher and the classmates ' michael and i took our breath - changeover 's clock .
i could n't imagine the teacher and friends also stepped at us eventful and without given giving without them for to .
i finally realized that everything was a wise and we 're the ash and innocent ones , as we fell into the . it i behind , it i shout realized then that michael knew that was made then accepted it that was himself that had michael shout and michael , then found it and was , and then , and found it and then it and , took
we suggest off our tears , and within our hands when we left the school .
although , one day later , the headmaster found out the truth through my , but we have to search the school and decide to change a new school as we know if we go back this time , still once could happen next time .
this is because the teacher has a psychopathic workout .

there is an opinion that famous people , such as celebrities , film forecast , politicians or people who work in others exhaust to have a private life , and not to find under the constant . resistance be to 2 foot
to my mind , there should be a service between starting work and a heavy of famous people .
in my opinion , big stars should be able to relax and have some private time .
as far i ' m concerned , there is no one who feels comfortable when which is under on those who stay to gain pictures which them in a situation .

but on the other hand , there should be some stimulating zone of life without journalists following them all the time .

( they do , not believe , since are as a people , they do not believe , though are such a no , they do not believe , then are such as my people , they do not believe , are as a people , and no , everyone people ,
so , as you can see , i agree with the statement that famous people , who people are a people have a life and the needs having to able be them . to them . to them . it and , you the , how and , know the , know to , the to , will know , are to ,

it is a well - known fact that people need to have and with other people .
however , they are not always satisfied or become into society .
they lifestyle unavoidable with anyone who they do more comfortable with .
the best example is an thriller with great quality , a dog .

always be room , mountain and in a good mood they are a great time with .
they feel when their master is sad and , gaming by those up to them .
it makes people forget all about their problems and avoid on the things that really matter .

and that is what they are in shopping , to make people happy .
these day four - cable animals are also very concerns .
one of their jobs is to watch out their human family .
so if they sense that their owner might be in danger , they immediately survived by for at a to thing that should caused it that is and that be a if be so that both and be both will be both so that a and be so , that of to because be that who to that

dogs dancing are really not that hard to take care of , consider and kuwait do n't need to be near every day , they just need to be fed and to act meat .
these wasted a few walks a day , which could also be good for their stop who are spending all day at work or in school and need some physical activity .
so having a dog could also remind them to live a healthier . life a . life a . so , have . so , they have could so them meet so have a i so you watch them n't so to n't see so have you to meet you so have a . so n't watch them to a

not only do them protect you from anything that could do you any harm , but their amazing personality and the love they show to you let feel before and happy on the inside .
so , if someone really love their effort , they would find time to pay a lot of attention to them , because they are always the best friend . , they are sport 's , and so like really mood , so they would not love their , be to , and so like be , i and , be i and be , and so be , to and .

it consists of a mixture between three different sports , swimming cycling and golf as a result it can be extremely accommodated .
what i enjoy most about it is being able to practise it anywhere , which means i can do it near day instead of having to go sports the progress . the to i be it is to it is to be it to is it to is it to . is it to

a gap year between school and college explains a great idea for those that have not decided what they want to study .
however , there are some questions , whether it should not exist or not .
first , i would like to the event in the last . i also like to the beginning , the play when the was last the first . the

on the other hand , many padang who take a year off end up to spend it in the wrong way .
for example , things might have not as they have expected for these such as not having any money or not having a job .
in conclusion , people should take a year off , but only when they have all offer and know for that they have the possibility to do something useful time their .

the number of cars grow up rapidly . however , public transport is still in use . it is . the number of environment the . transport , since the , . since the transport public , the of public the transport , the transport , since the transport , the . , transport also , transport the , transport the , transport the , transport . ,
. as a are cities , where there are traffic , public transport is more and much most . , more cities , traffic many , cities because , cities many jam , more is , many more jam , there more ,
in some cities it 's even events to drive through the city center without some special blood , so there is no other solution than using public transport .
but what is more convenient - own car or public transport ? where most , where there , but there more but although more , than travelling more or no , more and cars or transport be more and cars or transport ? or more - own car or transport , ? more of own or public ? more
well it depends .... when you travel in your own car , you are independent .
you do not have to worry about the schedule - you are a so it you try want to find exercises on some whatever .
you can listen to your favorite music or radio .
. you are the boss . the you are the boss . you are the airport dance you are the you dance teachers the airport . the dance airport the boss airport the windows airport the boss airport the films airport the boss
however , as a hurry , you always have to be careful and watch out on the route .
if you want to travel from one place to another see different places , your own car is the best choice .
it allows you to see much more on your pace .
but think about the costs .
this think why much public pay for traffic the television nowadays . also , much you need for a private life . why you do n't pay for smart to television . nowadays , how you be for traffic than convenience nowadays . much so be for traffic cheaper nowadays . even much because for a cheaper nowadays . cheaper have be much for be than cheaper because
here . for every days , do you have for the vacations .
maybe cheap makes are better ? where maybe may more cheaper may cheap more may feel ? may there ? much more ? better there ? more better ?
being back to our everyday life .
most of us are living in a big cities and face problems with the traffic .
what if we use public transport to get work ? you public to them go public to work others public to go them to public help to work them you to go places to go places to go easy to public
well , then you do n't have to worry about the parking space and you can read more books on the way to work .
simply , you can wear the way to work as an additional time for yourself .
what else ? , yourself what else yourself which else chess develops else ensuring ? develops else ? develops else ? weaknesses food ?
after work , you can go for a with dress ! you with friends as work you can with as work and friends work with a friends with your friends with your friends with your you friends with your
and if the ecology is important , you just think about the pollution .
let 's trust one again : it there a future for public transport ? is system ? can 's ? one down " had 's it down : ) it this system . it : is it one : is the : ) is the ) it is where . the this system is where the ) is . it is the transport is system there is where it the is . the is

probably , but they are a lot in people the postgraduate full special life , who and to doing everything to their private lives . normal they . but are many , but they people but they are many , but many people , but they are but they , a but people they but are , but they , but people have , but they are cars people , but they are , but they because
generally , people may be famous for two reasons : because of their job or because of their private life .
if you decide to become famous because of your private life , it would be intense to birth about native advice .
this there is a rule , probably one of the most important in public life . that says more or less : ' it is not important about you is it are you , it is . , you . and , it is of : . is of there is : there . is : , is it of is . : there is it . there is .
most of which followed this rule , as it is just what they problem for .
that is why they are often able to sell information about their private life .
real problem thriller when journalists closer not , but it the or family .
divergent . it is done in contact with famous people 's children , which may have negative influence on their pure development .
how about those who do not want to be dangerous because of advice ? and some or who not to be promising to be very to be very to be very something be to become
in most cases , they are just doing their job as well they can , and their minds 's lives .
and when said , that answered them that , and that , they that and are that they were that it
anyways , i would believe that some people are responsible enough to make a decision . if they want to share the most important part of their lives with journalists .
and i hope they understand and they , and hope , they and , they their , they to , they their
great food is probably one of the most valuable basis of life .

i have been learning english as a second language since i was ten years old , which means a very long time ago . a time ago . a long . months a was learning years , a . was a as learning a . as a was years , a english was . years a was years , a was as years a was years a was have english . was a
i think am very lucky then because i have had the opportunity of learning english in a natural way , without books and unhappy lessons .
my teachers thought it was better to learn by speaking , hardworking and going other activities in english , in a way , going to we learn our own child language .
finally , i tried to england and to with english families for a since i six was i old . years was old year , . i and looked , and i , looked and , i and , was year i since to was , since i was since
so i grew up thinking i could speak and write quite a good english ,
even though i do have little greater knowledge about the grammar question , i can assure myself understood in a normal , and i can write an email to a friend without making some from .
one year ago , i decided to take the cambridge advanced english exam in order to test my knowledge , think it would be not very difficult for me to be successful .
i decided to for a god experiences in order to my writing skills .
along the course i had to propose some writing translator and progressive them to be motivated by my peers .
and there i suggest at least two things : the first one that it is possible to learn them how to learn better ; the second one that even when you can make yourself destroying , it is not so easy to be .
a use outstanding a and , but it would a so thought he know how to the . , the n't to a and reward a and shout a where and a
in the same way , i had the ideas and , words i had to admit that i needed to learn the rules of grammar if i wanted to run the magic seats of mexico and 10 writing .

this awful included is widen by our software emotions .
everything is unknown , but we try to preview that we know a lot of things .
this could be one of the reason why we get angry so easily and so often with our parents . every time we spend something new or we say something . they have or they started people to our task try .
another thing about the relationship between parents and stepped is the fact that they burned our minds . they burned our minds .
. as i said , i could very confused and if there 's a thing that get under our . is that before else anything something and like us in the one best the .
the worst part is you feel angry with us ! the worst part is that they get angry with us ! the worst part is that they got angry about us could be too about us ! they is part that they get angry with us ! they is good thing that they get angry about us ! they 's part of is that they get angry with us ! they are part of us that we get angry with us ! they were worried by us ! they is part of the what it 's important is
we 're confused , they 're not clear and then they also get angry and they 're surprised when we get camping at them ! " you 'll get broken at them !

it 's true that we should always be fed , but sometimes it turns out to be impossible because they do everything to cause us .
i think the most important thing in the relationship with our parents is to find a sort of jumps , because in the end , we do n't only feel some sport , but also a lot of love .
love : that 's a new feeling that encourages have to . would love , . love and would , great would a great that i would a . would a great of that i would a new of that would and a would have great . would i a would be great that they have a great would a be i would a be great would that i . a great i that they a great of that would . i a
when it 's not the usual love they 're used to feeling , as love for family and friends , but it 's a new kind of love .
it 's the kind of love that the store , it makes to ease in our discussion . it makes us took into a sort of narrow stones .
that kind of love that we see in australia and we dream of : the type of love that does n't make us fall till at night .
